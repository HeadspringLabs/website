<h5><a href="http://www.headspring.com/headspring/mvc-boot-camp/">MVC 4 Training Curriculum</a></h5>
Created by Jimmy Bogard and Jeffrey Palermo, this course covers common development pitfalls and the ins and outs of writing maintainable systems. Instead of listening to lectures and doing boring written exercises, participants jump in and work on real code in an existing application. Our curriculum covers the latest version of MVC 4 and mobile web development.

Used in production since 2006, NServiceBus is the most popular open-source service bus for .NET and is found across industries including finance, healthcare, retail, SaaS, web2.0, and more. In this class, developers learn to use all the latest features, including the right ways to implement message exchange patterns and sagas. We'll also talk about architecting for integration, retries, fault tolerance, and scaling out processes across server farms.
