<p><strong>Legisym thrives on expertise and efficiency.</strong> To meet the needs of our customers, we must maintain expertise in two very specialized and rarely-understood areas: Drug Enforcement Administration regulations and Public Key Infrastructure technology. Being a newcomer to the market also requires that we do it more efficiently than our competitors. With a “lean” operating philosophy at the core of our business plan, our goal was to partner with other organizations who were experts in managing hardware and network environments, or who could supplement our internal software development efforts during times of peak demand.</p>
<p><strong>Finding capable partners is not easy.</strong> Our initial experience working with partners had mixed results. While we quickly found a highly professional organization to manage our hardware and network environment, our experience with software development partners left much to be desired. Then a trusted colleague who understood our needs and expectations suggested that we contact Headspring.</p>
<p><strong>After talking with Headspring, we got the feeling that they shared our passion for doing things right</strong>. We developed a sense of trust in their leadership team, and we tested the relationship by having them build our automated billing system.</p>
<p><strong>The system we needed was leading-edge and complex.</strong> It required sophisticated pricing logic, it had to interface with our internally-developed application, and it needed to comply with stringent requirements from our bank and the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p><strong>The automated billing system is a key component of our lean operating strategy.</strong> It gives us the capacity to grow rapidly and serve many more customers without having to change our business process – and without increasing our workload. This project allowed us to experience a pretty extensive range of Headspring’s capabilities and methods. By the time the system was finished, there was no question that Headspring would be a good partner for us.</p>
<p><strong>We end up with better systems because of how we work together.</strong> We have called on Headspring to assist us in a number of projects related to our core application, and they always find a way to put the right people on the job for us. Headspring personnel don’t just do what they’re told, they often ask hard questions and provide valuable insights that end up changing what we asked them to do – in a very positive way. Issues and misunderstandings are few and far between, and are remedied swiftly.</p>
<p><strong>The Headspring team has developed a great understanding of our business model</strong>, our technical architecture, the regulatory environment, and our culture. They respect our knowledge and expertise in our industry, and we enjoy a high level of trust in them and their work. Now the strategic partner that we envisioned when we originally wrote our business plan has a name – it’s Headspring.</p>
