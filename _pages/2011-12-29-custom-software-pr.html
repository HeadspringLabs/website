<h2 style="text-align: center;">ALL ABOUT BUSINESS</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">All too often, software companies offer development skills without the rudder of business acumen. At Headspring, we know that understanding your overarching business goals is key to developing successful software. That's why each of our engagements begins with a full understanding of your industry and business model, and we constantly ask questions and make adjustments as necessary throughout the project.</p>

<div class="one-third first" style="text-align: center;">

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5889" title="graphic-team" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/graphic-team.png" width="201" height="202" />
<h5>More Brains on Your Project</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the reasons many software companies fail is because they use cheap offshore development services. The money these companies seemingly save initial cost is eventually lost in development time, working efficiency, and project success. Headspring never offshores software development. Instead, our work is powered by a brain trust of 30 brilliant minds working from our Austin development laboratory. This collaboration empowers us to think outside of the box so that we can solve problems more quickly and ultimately be more successful.</p>

<h5>Minimize Your Risk</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">Developing a custom software project holds inherent risks. Working from the ground up on countless such projects has taught us all the ways projects can fail and also the steps to help them succeed. Headspring's history of outstanding success helps us manage uncertainties and mitigate risks so our clients are more comfortable throughout the process.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: left;">See Software Early and Often</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">Headspring believes the most important tenet of agile software development is to "release early and often." Our development process involves deep collaboration with your team throughout the project and predetermined strategic milestones. this accommodates valuable feedback from end-users at the most vital stages. We've found that delivering working software early and often means better workflow with fewer surprises, an earlier return on investment, and a reduced risk of not completing the project within the allocated budget.</p>
