<strong>DBITS – Service Oriented Architecture</strong>

<strong>If you have a deliverables-based IT project that falls within the above technology product categories, here’s how the process works:</strong>
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The process starts with the customer drafting a Statement of Work using the DIR DBITS template.</li>
	<li>Once prepared the customer sends the Statement of Work to one or more <a href="http://www.dir.texas.gov/ict/contracts/Pages/ResultsByProduct.aspx?a=TexasDIRProductType:'SERVICES'" target="_blank">DBITS Vendors</a> for that Technology Category.</li>
	<li>Vendors respond by submitting a Response to the Statement of Work with a fixed price, based on deliverables.</li>
	<li>Customer selects Vendor and simply issues a Purchase Order to the Vendor referencing the DBITS contract number.</li>
	<li>Project begins upon acceptance of the Purchase Order.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
The value of any one Statement of Work may not exceed $10 million, including all renewals, extensions and change orders. Each Statement of Work will describe the deliverables, the acceptance criteria for the deliverables and the service levels.
