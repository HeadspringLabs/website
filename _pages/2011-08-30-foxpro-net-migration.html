Converting from Visual FoxPro has become necessary for many companies as Microsoft will be dropping all support by 2015. The expense, time, and risk of converting a core legacy system can seem daunting. How do you know if switching is the best decision for you and your company? Analyzing the cost of losing a business critical system can help make that decision easier.

<strong>Top indicators your FoxPro system is business critical:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Employees use Daily or Weekly</li>
	<li>Your System is the Product</li>
	<li>Your System is Customer Facing</li>
</ul>
<strong>Even though there is no direct replacement for FoxPro the most time and cost effective switch is to another Microsoft platform, .NET.</strong>
