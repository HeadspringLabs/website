<strong>We had a project with lots of moving parts and high expectations. </strong>New requirements from the federal government for more environmental regulations on oil and gas led to us to gain a very large contract with a major player in the industry. Our client needed a system to collect and report information to the governing agency, and maintain their compliance with the new law. This kind of compliance project had never been done before, and the deadline was approaching fast.

<strong>We needed a partner we could trust,</strong> who we knew would do things right. Our success is based on a lean business model that critically relies on bringing the most appropriate and experienced skills sets to the table – but without the overhead expense of in-house staff. Partnering with the wrong group could have caused irreparable damage to our company.

<strong>Luckily, we knew about Headspring.</strong> Because of the critical nature of the project, we knew we would need to have direct contact with our consulting group. Headspring was local, and their collaborative approach and extreme responsiveness dovetailed perfectly with our needs. We liked that they had a lot of experience with large government and data mining and warehousing projects. Headspring’s use of FORTUNE 100 business practices and professional staff gave our large client an added level of comfort.

<strong>Headspring has helped us ask the tough questions. </strong>This project is both high-pressure and complex, and it launches into uncharted territory. Headspring has really helped us stay focused on our end goals. They’re not afraid to take the initiative and explore all the drawbacks, benefits and value-add of an approach. At the same time their process lets us know exactly where we are in the project and in our budget. Everything is open, honest and transparent.

<strong>Headspring offers us expansive team knowledge.</strong> Knowledge transfer time is obsolete, which is of the utmost importance in such a time-sensitive project. Because this is such a critical application, we’ve set up replicable processes, capitalizing on accumulated knowledge and maximizing the potential for future opportunities with our customer.

<strong>Now we can focus on more important parts of our business.</strong> We trust in Headspring’s ability to build the product correctly and make sure that it is exactly what we need. In fact, they have made such traction on the current tool that we may have the luxury of expanding the business-friendly capabilities of the software and enhancing value beyond our customer’s original budget and scope. Headspring is a key project team member in developing our custom software solutions.
