<strong>We were contracted by a national insurance company focused on managing health insurance for groups and individuals, to deliver training on making accessible ASP.NET apps.</strong>  Being experts in accessibility we wanted to partner with experts who could teach the different aspects of ASP.NET to the company team. So, we went to a winning contestant from our rally (we host an annual contest - Accessibility Internet Rally – where teams of web developers get together and learn about accessible design techniques, and they use the acquired knowledge to build a website pro-bono for a non-profit company) to ask for help.  He told me it wasn’t in their wheel house, but referred me to Headspring saying <strong>“they are the best in the business when it comes to ASP.NET.”</strong>

<strong>Upon meeting the Headspring team, it was immediately clear to me they had the knowledge and experience we were looking for.</strong>  We contracted onsite training with our client and the training was a huge success.  The training helped students understand how to create ASP.NET apps that would comply with a government audit on accessibility. The students enjoyed the training so much they enthusiastically recommended the same course be provided for their entire global development team.  They thought an online training portal would be a helpful and effective tool, and when they asked us to help create the portal, I came right back to Headspring.

<strong>Headspring was the right partner for this project. We knew creating this type of platform would be no easy task, but </strong>luckily, we were in the right hands with Headspring.  They asked the right questions, collected all the necessary information, and mapped out a game plan for delivery.  We were impressed with their ability to explore all the possibilities without losing focus of our ultimate goals for deployment. By analyzing all aspects of our needs and what tools and software were available, Headspring was able to create an accessible solution.

<strong>Headspring was communicative and considerate the whole way through. </strong>The first iteration shown to us needed some accessibility improvements, but once we addressed them with the team, Headspring took our feedback and improved the next version. I was pleasantly surprised by two things: no additional charges to make the requested changes and our requested changes were implemented right away. Headspring was open to our feedback, honest and understanding about our budget and needs, and provided impactful results for us and our client.

<strong>Headspring’s commitment to our success provided me with confidence in the direction of our project.</strong> If another project came along related to ASP.NET, I would definitely go to Headspring.  The entire team is very knowledgeable with great expertise in ASP.NET and they are very easy to work with.
