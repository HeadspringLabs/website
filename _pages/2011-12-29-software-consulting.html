<h2>Technical Design</h2>
<div class="one-third first large-font">

The Technical Design service we provide will typically involve (based on our customers’ needs) the components opposite.

Ensures your custom software will be the right solution for the problem that needs solving. Understanding your business and its processes is the catalysis for innovative design that will exceed end user expectations.
<h5><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5874" title="icon-flag" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/icon-flag.png" width="53" height="54" />Goal Setting</h5>
Collaboration with project stakeholders to define and priortize business objectives for the engagement and determine applicable ways to measure success.
<h5><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5875" title="icon-lightning" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/icon-lightning.png" width="53" height="54" />Risk Identification &amp; Mitigation</h5>
Answering the question “what could go wrong?” and developing plans to mitigate the identified risks. This is just another way we strive to achieve software development with no surprises.
<h5><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5876" title="icon-priorities" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/icon-priorities.png" width="53" height="54" />Feature Backlog Creation &amp; Prioritization</h5>
This is the creation of a detailed list of features categorized by functional area, that are then ordered to maximize the value of the project for the company.
<h5><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5877" title="icon-task" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/icon-task.png" width="53" height="54" />Project Milestones and Incremental Releases</h5>
Headspring believes the most important tenant of agile software development is to “release early and often.” We will work with the stakeholders to identify incremental production releases points. This allows for earlier return on investment and the incorporation of valuable feedback at the most vital stage from end users.
<h5><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5878" title="icon-flowchart" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/icon-flowchart.png" width="53" height="54" />Architecture Definition</h5>
Defining an elegant system architecture, that will maximize the opportunities for automated regression testing, is our passion and a key to producing maintainable applications. With our years of experience in this activity the process is quick and extremely effective.
<h5><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5879" title="icon-tools" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/icon-tools.png" width="53" height="54" />Key Tool Choices</h5>
Determining the best development tools and third-party libraries for a project is a crucial element to creating software effectively and allows for our software to remain within budget and time constraints. We use many tools to aid in development and you can see them in more detail on our tools and processes page.
<h5><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5880" title="icon-staff" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/icon-staff.png" width="53" height="54" />Staffing Assignments</h5>
Another important piece of the software development puzzle lies in selecting the correct team size and members for specific roles and responsibilities. If you choose to develop with Headspring, your team will be carefully selected based on the Headspring consultants that are best suited for your particular project.
<h5><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5881" title="icon-cost" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/icon-cost.png" width="53" height="54" />Cost Estimation</h5>
Once the above tasks have been completed, we are able to give our customers a precise estimate on what the development of the project will cost. With Headspring we are so confident our technical design phase is accurate we provide you with a “not-to exceed” bid. Meaning the number we give is the maximum amount you will ever pay for the defined project. If it costs less then you pay less.
