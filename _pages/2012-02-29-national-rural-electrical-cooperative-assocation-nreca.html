<strong>At NRECA, our members sell </strong><strong>approximately 12% of total electricity in the United States.</strong> We are the national service organization for more than 900 not-for-profit rural electric cooperatives and public power districts. We have an in-house development team that creates software and support products to help our members provide safe, reliable and affordable electrical service.

<strong>Each year, the best minds in the country come to our office to conduct in-house training.</strong> In the past we had taken people to trainings all over the country, but this is better. We find we get the most bang for our buck by pulling each groups’ training budget together and bringing experts in to have them do a custom training for all of us. That way the training can be tailored to our work and the specific problems we face in our day-to-day jobs.

<strong>We’re always thrilled with Headspring.</strong> Even before we met them, I was very familiar with Headspring by following the blogs, attending events with Headspring employees and using tools they have produced like AutoMapper and MVC Contrib. I have lots of respect for their people and what I have seen them do in the community.

<strong>And the more our developers know, the better our software will be.</strong> The training Headspring provides has given us ways to work within our organizational demands and helped us be more efficient with our code. Employees of all backgrounds learn new things and take away best practices and test concepts. The trainings increase the quality of our software, releases go up and other groups in our company get an introduction to the tech world. I have seen great advancements for the majority of our group and feel these skills have given them a leg up with their career growth.

<strong>Headspring provides the type of training most places don’t.</strong> They expose your team to best practices and tailor the training to with your problems and how to approach them better. We have currently gone through all Headspring’s major courses, but would highly suggest those trainings to others looking to get custom training on MVC and Agile. It’s a great service knowledge boost for to your team.
