The Texas Department of Informational Resources (<a href="http://www2.dir.texas.gov/ict/overview/pages/overview.aspx" target="_blank">DIR</a>) has awarded Headspring a Deliverables-based Information Technology Services contract (<a href="http://www2.dir.texas.gov/ict/contracts/Pages/Details.aspx?dir_contract_number=DIR-SDD-1784&amp;Return=http%3A//www2.dir.state.tx.us/ict/contracts/Pages/ResultsByProduct.aspx%3Fa%3DTexasDIRContractNumber%3A%271784%27" target="_blank">CONTRACT No. DIR-SDD-1784</a>).

This contract gives our customers in state and local government, public education and other public entities in Texas (as well as other public entities outside Texas) a streamlined purchasing process, eliminating the RFP process.

<strong>Technology Product Categories</strong>
<div class="accordion-1">
<h3><strong>DBITS - Application Development</strong></h3>
<div>

<strong>Definition:</strong> The development of new applications which may be mainframe, server, network-based, web-based or a combination. The requirements for new applications may require interfaces to existing applications.

<strong>Examples of included services:</strong> researching; analyzing; gathering requirements; designing; programming; testing; documenting and implementing; applying changes to the software language and/or database in which the application is written; providing corrections for production or any changes needed and participation in disaster recovery planning and documentation.

</div>
<h3><strong>DBITS - Technology Migration/Upgrade</strong></h3>
<div>

<strong>Definition:</strong> Technology Upgrade/Migration may be required to increase business functionality, reengineer a business function, keep current with vendor upgrades or when upgrading existing technology. Technology Transformation may be accomplished by converting/migrating legacy applications to new technology either with or without new business functionality or it may include introducing new technology into the enterprise. Technology Upgrade/Migration may also include providing website content accessibility compliance.

<strong>Examples of included services:</strong> assessments of the current application portfolio, evaluation of the technology assets before beginning technology transformation and Business Case development for justification of an initiative. Also included are: technology transformations, which may include, appropriate Return on Investment (ROI), benchmarks and milestones. The following activities may also be included: planning, analysis, requirements development, proof of concept, deployment, implementation, integration, remediation, data migration, documentation, application programming and support services; and training support.

</div>
<h3><strong>DBITS - Service Oriented Architecture</strong></h3>
<div>

<strong>Definition:</strong> SOA organizes business software in a granular fashion so that common functions can be used interchangeably by different departments internally and by external business partners. The more granular the components (the more pieces), the more they can be reused. SOA is a way of thinking about IT assets as service components. When functions in a large application are made into stand-alone services that can be accessed separately, they are beneficial to several parties. SOAs are implemented via application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow components to communicate with each other.

<strong>Examples of included services:</strong> planning and assessment; requirements development; proof of concept; implementation; deployment; governance; application programming and support services; system software administration and support; and training support.

<strong>If you have a deliverables-based IT project that falls within the above technology product categories, here's how the process works:</strong>
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The process starts with the customer drafting a Statement of Work using the DIR DBITS template.</li>
	<li>Once prepared the customer sends the Statement of Work to one or more <a href="http://www.dir.texas.gov/ict/contracts/Pages/ResultsByProduct.aspx?a=TexasDIRProductType:'SERVICES'" target="_blank">DBITS Vendors</a> for that Technology Category.</li>
	<li>Vendors respond by submitting a Response to the Statement of Work with a fixed price, based on deliverables.</li>
	<li>Customer selects Vendor and simply issues a Purchase Order to the Vendor referencing the DBITS contract number.</li>
	<li>Project begins upon acceptance of the Purchase Order.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
The value of any one Statement of Work may not exceed $10 million, including all renewals, extensions and change orders. Each Statement of Work will describe the deliverables, the acceptance criteria for the deliverables and the service levels.
