<h2>Summing It All Up</h2>
<p>We've covered a lot of ground over this series. We've talked about what kind of projects benefit from having an installer and why you should consider making one. We've learned what Windows Installer actually is (a feature of the Windows operating system) and what some of the tooling options for creating installers are. We've explored the sequence of events that occur when installing a package as well as the contents of an actual MSI package. We've dived into the basic structure of a WiX file and how an understanding of the Windows Installer concepts makes authoring WiX files easier. Coming full circle, we've created an installer package from WiX source with the WiX tooling.</p>
<p>There's certainly a lot left we could discuss: automatic file harvesting, custom actions, etc. However I haven't had much feedback on the series up to this point: Windows Installer is a niche topic in software development, especially with the rise of the web. I'm thinking about moving on to other topics.</p>
<h2>Last Call...</h2>
