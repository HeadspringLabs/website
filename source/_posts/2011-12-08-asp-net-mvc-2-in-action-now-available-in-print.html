<strong>Manning Publications and Headspring have updated the definitive guide to web application development using Microsoft's innovation ASP.NET MVC framework</strong>

<strong>Austin, Texas - June 18, 2010 -</strong> Available today is ASP.NET MVC 2 in Action, written by Headspring's Jeffrey Palermo (CIO), Jimmy Bogard, Matt Hinze, Eric Hexter, and Ben Scheirman. The text is an update of ASP.NET MVC in Action: with MvcContrib, NHibernate, and more. The authors have used ASP.NET since it was in beta, and Headspring Systems has standardized ASP.NET MVC as the user interface of choice for web applications. Applying their extensive hands-on experience, the authors delve into issues of architecture and maintainability. The book leads you hands-on from initiation through to real-life scenarios, focusing on how to create and maintain web applications.

To get the most value out of ASP.NET MVC, the book demonstrates how to implement in tandem with other technologies such as MvcContrib, a helper framework developed to ease MVC development. "We feel that MvcContrib is essential for its extra features, " explains Headspring CIO and MvcContrib co-creator Jeffrey Palermo, "It stays out of the way, but it is extremely useful to not have to write common extensions yourself." The book includes examples of how to approach MVC with Ajax, jQuery, and NHibernate.
