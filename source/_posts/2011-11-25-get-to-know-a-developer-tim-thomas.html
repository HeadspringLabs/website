<p>Tim Thomas is our un-official front-end expert at Headspring.  A gamer by any other name, Tim’s history of hobbies and interests have driven him to a full-fledge devotion for design and automation.</p>
<p>His preferred tools are Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Microsoft Visual Studio. To code, he uses HTML5, CSS3, Less, JavaScript, JQuery, ASP.NET MVC, and XNA Game Studio.  Tim has worked with and trained others on these technologies for years, written many blog posts, given presentations, and has used these technologies on many of his personal open source projects.</p>
<p>He’s useful too!  Look at the fine work he did for our new business cards:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/get-to-know-a-developer-tim-thomas/business-cards" rel="attachment wp-att-2307"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2307" title="business cards" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/business-cards-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>I asked him what he is especially interested in right now. He told me CSS3 “for the flexibility and freedom it affords Web Designers” and Web GL because “I see the next big wave of Web visualization being of the three-dimensional variety.”</p>
<p>Tim’s favorite book is <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> by William Lidwell, Kristina Holden, and Jill Butler. He’s constantly engaging his creative mind, as made evident by his expressed desire to “reconstruct the Headspring offices entirely out of Legos.”  He believes it’s important to connect with broader concepts in design and challenge himself. In fact, when asked what he would need if he were stranded on a deserted island, he told me a set of black <a href="http://www.getbuckyballs.com/">Buckyballs </a>would be essential.</p>
<p>Tim has a desire to share his passion for design with the community.  He is a founder and leader of the Central Texas XNA User Group (CTXNA). This organization holds monthly meetings to discuss game development with Microsoft technologies.  He also regularly attends and presents for the Austin .NET User Group (ADNUG) and Central Texas .NET User Group (CTXNDUG).  Maintaining a community presence also helps Tim stay updated with what’s new.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that, when I asked him of an ability he wished he had, he quickly responded “Teleportation!” I could see how this would be incredibly useful in keeping up with his community commitments.  He explained that really he would just like to enjoy traveling more; he feels that this ability could allow him to spend less time in transit, and more time actually enjoying destinations. I asked him if had any particular destinations in mind, and he told me the Pacific Northwest. “After I travel there, I find myself enriched, centered, and more often than not, highly caffeinated.”</p>
<p>With that said, “Cheers!” to Tim and his wife, as they welcome their first child, a baby girl, at the end of this month.</p>
