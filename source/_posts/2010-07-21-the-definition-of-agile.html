A good working definition for Agile: the release of software incrementally to production
in as many increments as possible, as often as possible

The number of increments and the frequency give a measure of how Agile an organization
or development team is.

What written requirements do for you is separate the responsibility between analyzing
the requirements for a system and constructing said software.
<h2>Defining requirements is a skill set not every developer necessarily has.</h2>

It is an intelligent division of labor to thus have one person in the role of defining
requirements in a very detailed way. Detailed requirements include pictures of the
screens to be developed (denoting exactly what the screens will look like) and every
business rule that happens behind the scenes to make the system function properly,
leaving only one way to implement the software. (There is only one way the software
may work after it is done.) By creating a division of labor a team may keep the party
good at developing requirements focused on developing requirements and the parties
developing software focused on developing software.

Documentation is absolutely necessary in any project, whether it is using the Agile
principles or not and whether the project is a software project or not. Documentation
is critical in the management and collaboration of human beings. Questioning whether
written requirements are Agile or not, attempts to juxtapose two completely unrelated
concepts. Written requirements are necessary for projects and requirements must be
documented.
<ul>
	<li>Written requirements also create a clear division between defects and enhancement
requests by way of source documentation on how a system should work.</li>
	<li>Written requirements are an excellent basis for user training documentation, as they
may be given to a technical writer who may ascertain how a system was supposed to
work and craft training documentation according.<!--more--></li>
	<li>Written requirements provide a critical written record that a project should have.
Once you decide that you are only going to write one sentence on an index card and
then ultimately throw that index card away, you don't have the benefit of that documentation
which can come in handy in a lot of different areas down the road.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ordering of Requirements</h2>
The way requirements are documented, whether they be on a 3" x 5" index card or in
a 12 page document, is a separate concern from the ordering of how requirements will
be worked. In an Agile project, a team does not have to define all requirements in
detail before beginning the development of the first feature. Requirements may be
defined just in advance of (at the last responsible moment before) the implementation
of the software. The extent to which the features are documented has no bearing on
the ordering.
