<p>A good working definition for Agile: the release of software incrementally to production<br />
in as many increments as possible, as often as possible</p>
<p>The number of increments and the frequency give a measure of how Agile an organization<br />
or development team is.</p>
<p>What written requirements do for you is separate the responsibility between analyzing<br />
the requirements for a system and constructing said software.</p>
<h2>Defining requirements is a skill set not every developer necessarily has.</h2>

<p>It is an intelligent division of labor to thus have one person in the role of defining<br />
requirements in a very detailed way. Detailed requirements include pictures of the<br />
screens to be developed (denoting exactly what the screens will look like) and every<br />
business rule that happens behind the scenes to make the system function properly,<br />
leaving only one way to implement the software. (There is only one way the software<br />
may work after it is done.) By creating a division of labor a team may keep the party<br />
good at developing requirements focused on developing requirements and the parties<br />
developing software focused on developing software.</p>
<p>Documentation is absolutely necessary in any project, whether it is using the Agile<br />
principles or not and whether the project is a software project or not. Documentation<br />
is critical in the management and collaboration of human beings. Questioning whether<br />
written requirements are Agile or not, attempts to juxtapose two completely unrelated<br />
concepts. Written requirements are necessary for projects and requirements must be<br />
documented.</p>
<ul>
<li>Written requirements also create a clear division between defects and enhancement<br />
requests by way of source documentation on how a system should work.</li>
<li>Written requirements are an excellent basis for user training documentation, as they<br />
may be given to a technical writer who may ascertain how a system was supposed to<br />
work and craft training documentation according.<!--more--></li>
<li>Written requirements provide a critical written record that a project should have.<br />
Once you decide that you are only going to write one sentence on an index card and<br />
then ultimately throw that index card away, you don't have the benefit of that documentation<br />
which can come in handy in a lot of different areas down the road.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ordering of Requirements</h2>
<p>The way requirements are documented, whether they be on a 3" x 5" index card or in<br />
a 12 page document, is a separate concern from the ordering of how requirements will<br />
be worked. In an Agile project, a team does not have to define all requirements in<br />
detail before beginning the development of the first feature. Requirements may be<br />
defined just in advance of (at the last responsible moment before) the implementation<br />
of the software. The extent to which the features are documented has no bearing on<br />
the ordering.</p>
