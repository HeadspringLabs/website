Typically, if you buy something off the shelf, it will be a fraction of the cost of
building it from scratch or something that's comparable. It will probably have much
more functionality as well (most of which you will not need). Most packages have a
lot of bells and whistles, and do a lot of things, but, typically, they also don't
do a lot of things that you need.

SalesForce, is an example of a package we use in our organization for contact management
and relationship management. It has a lot of features that we don't use. We probably
don't use sixty percent of the features that are in SalesForce. While that's a lot,
SalesForce is also more affordable for us to use than a custom app (something which
we're clearly capable of building on our own) that we would have to pour man hours
into developing. SalesForce meets our needs and it's at a fraction of the cost of
building something comparable.

Looking at the investment that it takes to get a product to market when you build
it, the long term stability of such a product, and thus the investment needed in the
name of stability, it is fair to say that typically when you build something from
scratch it has to be a core of and critical to your operations, and to your strategic
competitive advantage. It can't be something like SalesForce that is not really specifically
competitive to your organization.<!--more-->

If there is a product "off the shelf" that is applicable to your core business, then
it's probably a business need to work on differentiating yourself just a little bit
more.

The barrier to entry is so much higher when you build something that helps you gain
a strategic advantage over a competitor when compared to buying something off the
shelf that does everything, and yet if you can go buy a package that helps you run
a car-wash business (for example) there is not much spirited incentive for you to
go run that type of business, as if you can buy an off-the-shelf logistics package,
then anyone can go buy it and start a business of that ilk and be pretty competitive
with you. Alternatively, if you've got a strategic advantage and can build the software
that would help raise the barrier of entry for competitors and make you more money
while helping you keep a stronger hold on the market you're positioned in... you are
golden.

If you are planning to build the app that will give you a strategic advantage over
your competitors, Headspring is interested in speaking with you. Please <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact
