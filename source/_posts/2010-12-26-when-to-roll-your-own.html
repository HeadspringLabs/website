<p>Typically, if you buy something off the shelf, it will be a fraction of the cost of<br />
building it from scratch or something that's comparable. It will probably have much<br />
more functionality as well (most of which you will not need). Most packages have a<br />
lot of bells and whistles, and do a lot of things, but, typically, they also don't<br />
do a lot of things that you need.</p>
<p>SalesForce, is an example of a package we use in our organization for contact management<br />
and relationship management. It has a lot of features that we don't use. We probably<br />
don't use sixty percent of the features that are in SalesForce. While that's a lot,<br />
SalesForce is also more affordable for us to use than a custom app (something which<br />
we're clearly capable of building on our own) that we would have to pour man hours<br />
into developing. SalesForce meets our needs and it's at a fraction of the cost of<br />
building something comparable.</p>
<p>Looking at the investment that it takes to get a product to market when you build<br />
it, the long term stability of such a product, and thus the investment needed in the<br />
name of stability, it is fair to say that typically when you build something from<br />
scratch it has to be a core of and critical to your operations, and to your strategic<br />
competitive advantage. It can't be something like SalesForce that is not really specifically<br />
competitive to your organization.</p>

<p>If there is a product "off the shelf" that is applicable to your core business, then<br />
it's probably a business need to work on differentiating yourself just a little bit<br />
more.</p>
<p>The barrier to entry is so much higher when you build something that helps you gain<br />
a strategic advantage over a competitor when compared to buying something off the<br />
shelf that does everything, and yet if you can go buy a package that helps you run<br />
a car-wash business (for example) there is not much spirited incentive for you to<br />
go run that type of business, as if you can buy an off-the-shelf logistics package,<br />
then anyone can go buy it and start a business of that ilk and be pretty competitive<br />
with you. Alternatively, if you've got a strategic advantage and can build the software<br />
that would help raise the barrier of entry for competitors and make you more money<br />
while helping you keep a stronger hold on the market you're positioned in... you are<br />
golden.</p>
