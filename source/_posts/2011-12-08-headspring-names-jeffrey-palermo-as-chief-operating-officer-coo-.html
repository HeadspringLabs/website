<p><strong>Headspring promotes CIO</strong></p>
<p><strong>Austin, Texas - February 16, 2011</strong>Â - Headspring announces a promotion for Jeffrey Palermo from Chief Information Officer (CIO) to Chief Operating Officer (COO). Jeffrey has progressively transitioned in position to oversee all post-sales operations company-wide for Headspring and his change in designation reflects his growth.</p>
<p>A CIO is typically responsible for tackling new challenges and strategic initiatives and for setting the vision for an organization's technical direction. A COO, in contrast, is typically responsible for the health of an organization's overall production ensuring that day-to-day operations are smooth.</p>
<p>"Jeffrey continues to impress by taking on more and more responsibility and more ownership of mission-critical functions," said Dustin Wells, CEO of Headspring.</p>
