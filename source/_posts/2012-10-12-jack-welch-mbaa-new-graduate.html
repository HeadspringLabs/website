<p>If you aren’t familiar, Jack Welch was the CEO of <a href="http://www.ge.com/">General Electric</a> from 1981 to 2001.&nbsp; That’s a lot of years!&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, he shares his knowledge and experience with people like me – and whoever else enrolls in his MBA program.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" alt="Logo-strayer.png" align="right" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Logo-strayer.png">JWMI is a program hosted at <a href="http://www.strayer.edu/">Strayer University</a>, which is a nationwide university that has been around since 1892 – not as old as my alma mater, <a href="http://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&amp;M</a> (1872/6), but very proven.&nbsp; Chances are there is a Strayer location in a city near you.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate to have a great classmate who took the courses with me.&nbsp; <a href="http://headspring.com/kevin">Kevin Hurwitz</a>, the Chief Architect at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a>, also just received his MBA from JWMI.&nbsp; Each course, we were able to swap notes and apply the knowledge every week at Headspring.</p>
<p>Throughout the two years, I completed courses on a broad range of topics.&nbsp; They are listed here.&nbsp; As I blog about what I have learned and applied in each course, I’ll link to that blog from this list.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.headspring.com/jeffrey/jack-welch-mba-course-business-communication-and-ethics/">Business Communications and Ethics</a>
<li>Leading in the 21st Century
<li>Strategy
<li>People Management
<li>Marketing in a Global Environment
<li>Managerial Economics
<li>Operations Management
<li>Financial Management I
<li>Organizational Change and Culture
<li>Financial Management II
<li>New Business Ventures and Entrepreneurship
<li>Capstone (simulation)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very happy to have attended and graduated from the Jack Welch Management Institute.&nbsp; My contribution to Headspring has materially benefited from the learning.&nbsp; Also, I am so excited that several other Headspringers have decided to enroll for this semester!</p>
