<h2>SalesForcesque</h2>
A CRM system like SalesForce.com represents a non-core competency of most businesses and most businesses don't want to build their own CRM, <strong>and yet</strong> a CRM is critical to their operations. SalesForce probably meets about 80% of the needs of most, but that leaves about 20% of needs wherein SalesForce could stand to be tweaked.<!--more--> And so, in a scenario where you need SalesForce-only-different, you have to make the business decision on if it makes sense to build something either as an add-on or from scratch or to just make do with the 80% and take a sacrifice so that you're not investing a lot of capital dollars in custom development when you have a package that meets most of your needs.

A lot of clients appreciate the trade-off, reasoning: "I found a package. Why do I need to find exactly what I want?"

If the twenty percent that is missing from the package is critical to your business or your competitive advantage then <a title="Consulting &amp; Development" href="services/consulting-development" target="_blank">you probably do need to build something</a> versus buying it off of the shelf.
