<p>We’ve all been there… You are walking into the grocery store around the holidays and by the entrance are the familiar red kettle and the ringing bell. You would like to donate, <em>or maybe you wouldn’t</em>, but its 2011, who carries cash anymore?  Fact of the matter is, its 2011, debit and credit cards are the norm… Thus enter the “Square.”<!--more--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You haven’t seen this yet? Chances are that if you haven’t, you will be just as puzzled as me as to why this wasn’t created years ago. The “Square” is a peripheral device that connects to your smart phone via the headphone jack, and is designed to take payments from virtually anywhere. Pretty cool, huh? We will see…</p>
<p>I notice two fatal flaws with this technology that may cause a ruckus:</p>
<ul>
<li>I mentioned the red kettle and bell earlier, the approach this year is to allow Red Cross volunteers to take donations with this new technology. Predictions are that this new trend will grow for not just philanthropic organizations, but Girl Scout troops selling cookies, fundraisers, and of course small to big business. Will the ease of these debit/credit card transactions be a blessing or a curse? No longer can the excuse, “I don’t carry cash,” be used to avoid signing up for the magazine subscription that knocks on the front door. “I only carry credit cards,” can’t be a cop out for those that just don’t wish to buy or donate. I don’t believe that everyone who uses this line are dishonest - lying to avoid an unplanned transaction. But will this accessibility make it harder to opt out, ultimately taking away the ability to choose?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I really don’t have to go into much depth on the second flaw - security.  Would the use of the “Square,” be like leaving your front door open?  I don’t like to be cynical, but it’s a reality that needs to be addressed. How safe is the information transmitted from a stranger’s smart phone to the credit card vendor? Also, smart phones are connected to the world through wireless signals (the easiest signal to hack into). We should be cautious about trusting this technology the same way we trust Amazon to have our credit card information on file for future purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is this a good thing or a bad thing? I do know one thing for sure, my wife won’t be happy when I come home with a $100 charge on the credit card and 20 boxes of thin mints.</p>
