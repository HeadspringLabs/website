<p><strong>With regards to kicking off projects, one should not have a project with:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>fixed budget<br />
What we see most often at Headspring with our software projects is that most clients go through their own self process to get the budget approved, and that doing so is a big deal. Often times, the budget is a fixed factor.</li>
<li>fixed scope<br />
As far as scope or the number of features goes, our clients always have a goal, but rarely are goals fully specified-out at the<!--more--> beginnings of projects to the extent blueprints are for commercial buildings as just creating blueprints (or the equivalent thereof) costs a lot of money.</li>
<li>fixed time<br />
We often find that a client does have a goal and they also have a range on the calendar for when they'd like it delivered by, so it is the budget we most often see as the fixed factor.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's widely known, and widely published in project management literature, that regardless of whether renovating an old town courthouse or undertaking a software project, if you try to peg the budget, try to peg the finishing date, and try to peg the exact scope of the deliverables up front and plan all three out before even starting on the project then none of them actually happen as planned.</p>
<p><strong>So, what's the middle ground? What's the workable solution?</strong></p>
<p>(This is what we really want to get to.) We help clients come up with a goal which can be within the budget, and most often the client's goal can be accomplished within the budget they've allocated for the project. This is where project management experience comes into relevancy, not unlike how in the building of a custom home an experienced homebuilder is going to give you options allowing you to build your dream house within a low budget and to build a house that really, really suits you. Even if it's not even 6,000 square feet, it will be a house that you're really, really happy with, and software comparably doesn't need to be massive, sprawling features everywhere across 600 screens.</p>
<p><strong>The software needs to fit your business.</strong></p>
<p>It needs to help you do business effectively. As with houses and cars, bigger isn't better necessarily. Getting the right software is what you really want.</p>
<p>One of the things we do at <a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/ct.ashx?id=9e451b7e-e8c1-411e-86d3-8b69657be7bc&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.headspring.com%2f" target="_blank">Headspring</a> is to help clients meet their goals with the budget that they've set forth. It's a rare situation where we can't help them meet their business needs.</p>
<p>So what are the challenges when a client has a project with a fixed budget? Once a team starts building the client may start doing kind of a "gold plating." How do you maintain the scope relevant to the budget?</p>
<p>This is where the conventional wisdom in the Agile methodology sort of breaks down. (We employ Agile at Headspring and an Agile process is really the context of this topic.) The widely accepted vision of Agile suggests you just get started and you just start iterating and you just work two weeks at a time, and, lo and behold, like magic, everything will work itself out. This is rarely, rarely true. In reality, you have to have a solid plan going in.</p>

<p>In building a house one doesn't start construction from the napkin sketch. One doesn't start construction with an eight inch drawing. You have to spend a little bit of time building a blueprint. Now, you may go ahead and start building the foundation well before the detailed electrical drawings are completed, and that's just fine because as long as you've specified-out out enough information on the blueprints, you may indeed build the foundation and you're going to be okay.</p>
<p>In software, even though we're not bound by physical materials, it's the same thing. We don't have to spec out everything just to get started, but we have to spec out what we're going to get started on. If we're going to get started on a customer listing/customer search style of functionality for a call center, we have to specify what the behavior is going to be.</p>
<p>In escaping the waterfall model or Big Design Up Front (BDUF) and creating large SRS documents a huge part of the industry has gone from over-specifying (trying to specify the entire application before beginning on anything) to swinging all the way to the other extreme by not specifying anything in favor of just starting and trying to figure things out along the way.</p>
<p>You have to have moderation. You have to be balanced. You have to be somewhere in the middle, and we have found that iterating small milestones is very, very valuable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the milestones must be comprehensively planned if you expect to reliably achieve the milestone and have any accuracy in the estimate that you're going give for the milestone.</li>
<li>A milestone is 2 to 4 weeks of work. Anyone should be able to plan, estimate and adequately specify 2 to 4 weeks of work and be able to deliver it. Then just rinse and repeat fully. (Plan out the next milestone and execute it.) You don't have to plan a full year's worth of the project, but you should be able to plan out several weeks comprehensibly.</li>
<li>When people have a little more stake in a project from a delivery standpoint or stakeholder's standpoint or an executive sponsor's standpoint they will be empowered with the ability to always, always check would be development against the goal of the project.
<ul>
<li>This provides daily guarding against straying from the goal. Whenever a team starts discussing a feature and what it needs to do in specifying a 2 to 4 week iteration, it will be checked against the project vision and the overall goal of what is really needed to be done for the business in mind.</li>
<li>If everyone is thinking about and checking against the goal and its constraints then a team is going to be mitigating risks pretty well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discouraging Extravagance and Distractions</strong></p>
<p>Some people may just want a fancy feature that has got some sort of UI widget that they "just have to have" and that could lead to some hard conversations. What checks and balances does Headspring employ to help with that?</p>
<p>We're not just programmers. We're a consulting company, and anytime you throw in the word "consulting" that throws in the words "opinions" and "recommendations" and bringing experience from a multitude of other clients and other projects to bear on an immediate project. One thing that we consistently ask clients whenever they describe what a feature needs to do is the question: "Are you sure you want to spend that much?" Asking a question that way gets the client thinking: "Is there an alternative that I may spend less upon to get the same amount of value?" Having such a dialog to present a client with alternatives for how to accomplish the same business goal by investing less is always a sound business conversation to have.</p>
