<p>We often think of bonding and rapport as something done with clients, but it’s just as valuable with your colleagues.  At Headspring, we believe it’s important to celebrate our successes and reenergize by bonding as a team.  We do this daily through teamwork, but every once in a while we simply need to have some fun together.  For our Q3 get together, we teamed up with City Sleuth, an expert city scavenger hunt company, to enjoy an afternoon of solving riddles and scavenging around downtown.  We sure got to know Austin really well!  In the end, we honored team members with awards, ate a great lunch, and created memories outside of the office environment.<!--more--></p>
