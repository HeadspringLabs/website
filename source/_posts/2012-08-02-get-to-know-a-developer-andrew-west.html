<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/andrew-west.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5681" title="andrew west" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/andrew-west-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>This week's developer actually started last week: Andrew West, Senior Consultant.  Andrew has been riding the contract train for all kinds of companies for about 10 years.  He's done some server side work for mobile geo-caching apps, developed a bar code app for hazardous waste tracking in the healthcare industry, worked on projects in the financial and academic worlds, and more.  Now, he's happy to give Headspring and our clients his full attention, telling me that he intentionally steered away from other offers because he knew he wanted to work here.  Here's more of our conversation:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I have a lot of experience with C#, ASP.NET MVC, and relational databases, but the learning process never ends.  I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>I’m fascinated by the space industry, so it would be interesting to work with clients in that field.  I’m amazed by things like the Mars Science Laboratory mission.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>When I was 9 or 10 years old my parents gave me a toy computer.  It only had 2 kilobytes of RAM and a 16-character display, but I managed to create simple games with it.  Eventually I learned to program the Apple II, TRS-80, and IBM PC.  By the time I was in high school, I knew I wanted a career in software.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>I started out learning various dialects of BASIC.  A few years later I learned C++ and x86 assembly language.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Teaching a room full of people can be intimidating, but it’s still a great experience if you don’t worry too much about being perfect.  I learn a lot when I’m preparing to teach.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I still like to read books in hard copy format.  Reading a technical book from cover to cover gives me a broader understanding of a new technology than reading online code examples or documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree, Andy. Hard copy books for life!  To learn more, tweet: <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewtwest">@andrewtwest</a></p>
