<strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong>

I have a lot of experience with C#, ASP.NET MVC, and relational databases, but the learning process never ends.  I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills.

<strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong>

I’m fascinated by the space industry, so it would be interesting to work with clients in that field.  I’m amazed by things like the Mars Science Laboratory mission.

<strong>What led you to software development?</strong>

When I was 9 or 10 years old my parents gave me a toy computer.  It only had 2 kilobytes of RAM and a 16-character display, but I managed to create simple games with it.  Eventually I learned to program the Apple II, TRS-80, and IBM PC.  By the time I was in high school, I knew I wanted a career in software.

<strong>What did you learn first?</strong>

I started out learning various dialects of BASIC.  A few years later I learned C++ and x86 assembly language.

<strong>Do you like teaching?</strong>

Teaching a room full of people can be intimidating, but it’s still a great experience if you don’t worry too much about being perfect.  I learn a lot when I’m preparing to teach.

<strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong>

I still like to read books in hard copy format.  Reading a technical book from cover to cover gives me a broader understanding of a new technology than reading online code examples or documentation.

I agree, Andy. Hard copy books for life!  To learn more, tweet: <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewtwest">@andrewtwest</a>
