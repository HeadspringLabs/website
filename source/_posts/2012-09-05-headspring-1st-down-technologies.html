<p><strong>AUSTIN, TX – Sept, 2012,</strong> Headspring, an Austin-based software development company, today announced the launch of FirstDown PlayBook™ Youth, a football app for mobile and tablet devices developed for 1st Down Technologies, LLC, an Austin-based sports software company.</p>
<p>FirstDown PlayBook™ Youth app is a tool for youth league football coaches and players to browse formation packs full of professionally drawn plays, create playbooks, and develop practice and game plans. The app also allows users to print the coach’s playbook and player wristband sheets.  Using HTML5 technology, the playbook is web-based and gives coaches and players immediate access on multiple mobile and tablet devices. Real-time changes can be made offline during football games and updated online when an Internet connection is available. </p>
<p>“Working with the team at 1st Down Technologies on this innovative football app has been a lot of fun,” said Kevin Hurwitz, chief architect of Headspring. “By creating the program with HTML5 versus iOS, the technology is compatible on virtually all mobile and tablet devices, which allows flexibility and caters to the different platforms used by coaches and players.”</p>
<p>Coach Charlie Coiner, 27-year veteran at both the NFL and NCAA levels, and current assistant coach of a division one NCAA football team, founded 1st Down Technologies in 2011.  His goal was to help coaches at all levels spend more time developing youth football players and less time consumed with designing plays.
