Austin Code Camp has become a running tradition in the Austin area.  I still have a t-shirt from 2007 I occasionally mow the yard in!  While Austin Code Camp doesn't give out t-shirts anymore, it's still focused on providing FREE sessions for the development community, by members of the community.  This year's event is going to be June 9th.  You can register over at <a href="http://austincodecamp2012.com/">http://austincodecamp2012.com/</a>.

A number of Headspringers are going to be presenting sessions this year.  The subjects cover a lot of varied ground - from introductions to deep dives, and focuses ranging from managing technology to managing your career.

Here's a list of what Headspringers are going to be presenting or facilitating:

Steve Donie – Client Side JavaScript Frameworks
Sharon Cichelli - Crafting your Career
Nolan Egly - Cryptography 101
Alonso Robles - Getting Started with Raven DB
Patrick Lioi - Building a Language
Tim Thomas - Avoiding the Threat of Awful CSS, Web Usability on a Budget
Anne Epstein - Don't Do This in NHibernate, Lightning Talks!
Jeffrey Palermo - Star Schema and Reports, Onion Architecture

We hope to see you there! (Did I mention it's FREE?)
