We've hired three amazing new developers in the month of July! The first of which is Kyle Nunery, Senior Consultant. He relocated from Florida for the position. Kyle lucked out, because his first Friday with us happened to be a quarterly company offsite at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/small-talk-and-big-news/new-office-and-k1-racing/">K1 Speed Go Kart Racing</a>. He and I joined the rest of the crew for lunch at Chuy's (yum!) before we headed to the track.  There, we talked with Tim Thomas about the direction of front-end development and how crucial Javascript knowledge has become. Interesting talk. Here are some other things he had to say:<!--more-->

<strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong>

I like to think I am an expert at building business websites.  My strongest programming languages are C# and JavaScript.

<strong>What led you to software development?</strong>

In middle school I wanted to make a video game, so my step dad bought me a book on programming in C.  This passion for programming continued on into college and led to my career in software development.

<strong>What did you learn first?</strong>

My first programming language was C using the Borland Turbo C++ compiler.

<strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong>

I will typically build many small programs testing out various features of a new technology.  Besides reading blogs and Googling I will often reference books via Safari Books Online.

<strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong>

At work, “time well spent”, is anything that will help in delivering the highest quality solution for your customer as quickly as possible.

<strong>What are your plans for the future?</strong>

I am interested in making more mobile applications.  In general, I would like to become a stronger voice in the development community.
