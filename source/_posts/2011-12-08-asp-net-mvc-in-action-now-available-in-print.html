<h2>Manning Publications and Headspring Systems announce the definitive guide to web application development using Microsoft's innovative ASP.NET MVC framework</h2>
<strong>Austin, Texas</strong> - <strong></strong>Available today, <strong><em>ASP.NET MVC in Action: With MvcContrib, NHibernate, and more</em></strong>, written by Headspring Systems' Jeffrey Palermo and Jimmy Bogard, with coauthor Ben Scheirman, published by Manning Publications Co. This clearly-written introduction to the ASP.NET MVC framework and the MVC approach to web development is already being described by reviewers like Microsoft MVP Mohammad Azam as "a true masterpiece."

Authors Palermo, Scheirman, and Bogard have used ASP.NET since its first beta, and Headspring Systems, has standardized ASP.NET MVC as the user interface of choice for web applications. Applying their extensive hands-on experience, the authors dive into issues of architecture and maintainability. The book leads you hands-on from first-use through real-life scenarios, focusing on how to create and maintain real web applications.

To get the most value out of ASP.NET MVC, the book demonstrates how to implement it in tandem with other technologies such as MvcContrib, a helper framework developed to ease MVC development. Headspring CTO and MvcContrib co-creator Jeffrey Palermo explains, "We feel that MvcContrib is essential for its extra features. It stays out of the way, but it is extremely useful to not have to write common extensions yourself." The book includes examples of how to approach MVC with Ajax, jQuery, and NHibernate.

Mohammed Azam, a Microsoft MVP, raves "The authors, Jeffrey Palermo, Ben Scheirman and Jimmy Bogard are all considered rock stars in the ASP.NET community and they have opened up the doors to their concert with<em>ASP.NET MVC in Action</em>." Reviewer Bobby Johnson comments, "They successfully embedded some subversive ALT.NET concepts that will hopeful make us all better developers. And at the end of the day that is a damn fine accomplishment."
