<p>What are the challenges of bootstrapping product management for a large project?</p>
<p><img style="margin: 2px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/largeproject.gif" alt="Large Project" border="0" /></p>
<p>There are some things that one will want to accomplish at the beginning of a large<br />
project. The first is to get the product owner really comfortable with the domain<br />
and any legacy systems that will be replaced by the system you're building. Knowledge<br />
of how things are done in a legacy system and knowledge of how a business or organization<br />
operates are indispensable during the execution of the project long term.</p>
<p>This assumes that you've already gotten past "What's the budget?" Someone has to find<br />
the ultimate goal. Assuming that we know the goal of the project and that it's budgeted<br />
for, how do we tactically actually begin starting the project?</p>
<h2>Break the project up into smaller projects.</h2>
<p>One of the most important things to start with is to not start a large project. The<br />
large projects are the ones most at risk to fail and become projects which can't deliver<br />
ultimate value too. It is very important to break large projects up into small projects,<br />
each one being a major milestone and perhaps each one being a three-month project<!--more--><br />
allowing one to believe "Okay, this is a three month project and we're going to achieve<br />
success in 3 months. We're going to see the system in production in 3 months."</p>
<ul>
<li>A small project is not going to serve all of the various types of users that need<br />
to be served obviously, because there is a lot of work to be done in the greater scope,<br />
but a small project (a major milestone) can be targeted to serve perhaps one or two<br />
users of the target user groups. Those user groups are then able to begin using the<br />
system that is grown as soon as three months into the project timeline, providing<br />
real production feedback as the second milestone is worked upon.</li>
<li>It is important to get a system into production as if you cannot get users used to<br />
it in six to nine months, you will start to be at risk for failure. Fred Brooks, in<br />
his book The Mythical Man Month, has a chart detailing that at the 18-month mark,<br />
if a project still isn't in production and users still haven't used a single feature,<br />
a project has a greater than fifty percent risk for failure according to Brooks' estimation.</li>
<li>It's very important to break a large project into small projects and then succeed<br />
on the smaller ones, one at a time, because if you can't achieve success on something<br />
small early then you are not on track for achieving success in the large scale.<br />

</ul>
<h2>The Rollout Plan</h2>
<p>The key is creating a rollout plan and this is where the bulk of your efforts should<br />
be in the planning process. Create a rollout plan that is realistic and takes into<br />
account any legacy systems (and the data migration that would have to be done from<br />
those legacy systems into what you're building) and any integration points that you<br />
will need to build, so that what you create, in these incremental milestones may be<br />
integrated into the larger portfolio of applications the organization uses, and can,<br />
and this is the most important point, be put into production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your planning also has to take into account other things that are often overlooked<br />
such as</p>
<ul>
<li>the procuring of the deployment environment (hardware necessary to put software on)</li>
<li>any training issues that will need to be done for users to get them into the new system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The details of what will be in each module or each releasable sub-application (piece<br />
of the larger application) can be left to the Agile project planning process, but<br />
an idea of the milestones and the rollout plan for the milestones is absolutely critical<br />
at the beginning of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>In having smaller chunks for your project, you will have smaller deliverables. How<br />
do you plan for each of these modules? How do you start the Agile project management<br />
process? Now that you've broken up your project into smaller projects, how do you<br />
kick start them? How do you prevent writing a huge specifications document out of<br />
an inability to know how far to detail planning and when not to go into detail?</p>

<div style="width: 600px; height: 300px;">
<div style="padding-left: 40px; width: 207px; float: left; height: 300px;">Once you<br />
have the rollout plan broken up into 6-week to 3-month increments, depending on project<br />
specifications, you may drill down into each of the 6-week to 3-month smaller deliverables<br />
and create what Agile terminology has called a product backlog. A product backlog<br />
is a list of one or two sentence descriptions of the goals of each of the features<br />
or function points within a deliverable, and the nice thing about creating a smaller<br />
project within a larger project, a three month project for example, is that one may<br />
arrive at a backlog that would be in the order of only <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">fifty<br />
to sixty items</span></strong> long and thus very attainable.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 146px; width: 207px; float: left; height: 300px;">If you<br />
find that you're coming up with a list that is closer in size to <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">one<br />
hundred fifty features</span></strong> it suggests an opportunity to see if you've<br />
defined the release of your incremental application to be too large in scope. Refactor<br />
your rollout plan to account for this. Get 50 to 60 features and estimate the size<br />
of them. Lay them out over, again using a 3-month example, a 12-week period, and then<br />
begin to execute finding the specific requirements for each of the features.</div>
</div>
<p>Get some lead time before beginning the incremental deliverables so that you have<br />
requirements ready to go for actual development, a two to three week lead time to<br />
get some well-defined requirements. In beginning with lead time, you can execute,<br />
on a weekly basis, staying two to three weeks ahead of the development team with very<br />
detailed requirements that are actionable for them.</p>
<h2>Fear the stakeholder's fears... Just don't share them</h2>
<p><img style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/stakeholderfears.jpg" alt="Stakeholder Fears" border="0" /></p>
<p>It is very important to protect the backlog. When you define a small milestone, it<br />
is very easy for some of the stakeholders to come forward to say "We should add this<br />
in, and we should do this as well. It is really going to be critical to this, and<br />
we don't want to paint ourselves in a corner." The concerns may be raised in anticipation<br />
of the sixth milestone instead of an attention to the immediate milestone. You will<br />
need to structure architecture so that you indeed don't paint yourself in a corner,<br />
but also don't go in the opposable direction from where you need to go overall. You<br />
still have the knowledge of where you need to go overall, but you should actively<br />
defer the items that are not in the first milestone, because it is more important<br />
to achieve success on the first milestone and to move on, than it is to satisfy fears<br />
of what might happen in the sixth milestone.</p>
<p>Depending on the client, it may be important to have not only the backlog, which is<br />
the approved and official feature list, but also an unbudgeted wish list for future<br />
things, so that there is a forum where people can put in items that won't be forgotten.</p>
<p>Once you set the goals for a 6-week to 3-month project, any capable project manager<br />
and or architect is going to be able to achieve success for something of that scope.<br />
That is a very short period of time.</p>
<h2>Legacy Systems</h2>
<p>A lot of organizations have a legacy system or more than one legacy system that will<br />
be replaced by a new project being undertaken. A really intelligent way to order milestone<br />
prioritization in those situations is to dedicate, depending on the length of the<br />
project of course, your first milestone or your first couple of milestones to only<br />
replacing the features in the legacy system or systems that an organization wishes<br />
to keep. There is obviously no point in rebuilding functionality that is not used<br />
or not valuable, but for the functions that are valuable, it makes sense to replace<br />
those as is (or with some minor modifications to the user interface or other productivity<br />
features) and to get those into production.</p>
<ul>
<li>What that allows you to do is to, as is learned in driving school, separate dangers,<br />
so you minimize the risk that the standing up of the development environment, that<br />
enables new business processes, will be time consuming.</li>
<li>The first milestone or milestones then essential amount to a technical upgrade wherein<br />
the requirements of the project may be driven by the design of an existing system.<br />
Ultimately, almost everybody would admit you are absolutely going to need the legacy<br />
functionality to move forward, so it's better to get that out of the way early.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overcome the challenge of going to production</h2>
<p>Then, incrementally or even on a biweekly or monthly basis, begin to release small<br />
new feature sets to users and ease into growing the system rather than releasing a<br />
massive amount of new functionality on one day. From a risk management standpoint,<br />
there is just no comparison between the two approaches.</p>
