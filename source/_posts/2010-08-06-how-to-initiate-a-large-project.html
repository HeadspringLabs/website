What are the challenges of bootstrapping product management for a large project?

There are some things that one will want to accomplish at the beginning of a large
project. The first is to get the product owner really comfortable with the domain
and any legacy systems that will be replaced by the system you're building. Knowledge
of how things are done in a legacy system and knowledge of how a business or organization
operates are indispensable during the execution of the project long term.

This assumes that you've already gotten past "What's the budget?" Someone has to find
the ultimate goal. Assuming that we know the goal of the project and that it's budgeted
for, how do we tactically actually begin starting the project?
<h2>Break the project up into smaller projects.</h2>
One of the most important things to start with is to not start a large project. The
large projects are the ones most at risk to fail and become projects which can't deliver
ultimate value too. It is very important to break large projects up into small projects,
each one being a major milestone and perhaps each one being a three-month project<!--more-->
allowing one to believe "Okay, this is a three month project and we're going to achieve
success in 3 months. We're going to see the system in production in 3 months."
<ul>
	<li>A small project is not going to serve all of the various types of users that need
to be served obviously, because there is a lot of work to be done in the greater scope,
but a small project (a major milestone) can be targeted to serve perhaps one or two
users of the target user groups. Those user groups are then able to begin using the
system that is grown as soon as three months into the project timeline, providing
real production feedback as the second milestone is worked upon.</li>
	<li>It is important to get a system into production as if you cannot get users used to
it in six to nine months, you will start to be at risk for failure. Fred Brooks, in
his book The Mythical Man Month, has a chart detailing that at the 18-month mark,
if a project still isn't in production and users still haven't used a single feature,
a project has a greater than fifty percent risk for failure according to Brooks' estimation.</li>
	<li>It's very important to break a large project into small projects and then succeed
on the smaller ones, one at a time, because if you can't achieve success on something
small early then you are not on track for achieving success in the large scale.

</ul>
<h2>The Rollout Plan</h2>
The key is creating a rollout plan and this is where the bulk of your efforts should
be in the planning process. Create a rollout plan that is realistic and takes into
account any legacy systems (and the data migration that would have to be done from
those legacy systems into what you're building) and any integration points that you
will need to build, so that what you create, in these incremental milestones may be
integrated into the larger portfolio of applications the organization uses, and can,
and this is the most important point, be put into production.
<ul>
	<li>Your planning also has to take into account other things that are often overlooked
such as
<ul>
	<li>the procuring of the deployment environment (hardware necessary to put software on)</li>
	<li>any training issues that will need to be done for users to get them into the new system</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>The details of what will be in each module or each releasable sub-application (piece
of the larger application) can be left to the Agile project planning process, but
an idea of the milestones and the rollout plan for the milestones is absolutely critical
at the beginning of the project.</li>
</ul>
In having smaller chunks for your project, you will have smaller deliverables. How
do you plan for each of these modules? How do you start the Agile project management
process? Now that you've broken up your project into smaller projects, how do you
kick start them? How do you prevent writing a huge specifications document out of
an inability to know how far to detail planning and when not to go into detail?

<div style="width: 600px; height: 300px;">
<div style="padding-left: 40px; width: 207px; float: left; height: 300px;">Once you
have the rollout plan broken up into 6-week to 3-month increments, depending on project
specifications, you may drill down into each of the 6-week to 3-month smaller deliverables
and create what Agile terminology has called a product backlog. A product backlog
is a list of one or two sentence descriptions of the goals of each of the features
or function points within a deliverable, and the nice thing about creating a smaller
project within a larger project, a three month project for example, is that one may
arrive at a backlog that would be in the order of only <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">fifty
to sixty items</span></strong> long and thus very attainable.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 146px; width: 207px; float: left; height: 300px;">If you
find that you're coming up with a list that is closer in size to <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">one
hundred fifty features</span></strong> it suggests an opportunity to see if you've
defined the release of your incremental application to be too large in scope. Refactor
your rollout plan to account for this. Get 50 to 60 features and estimate the size
of them. Lay them out over, again using a 3-month example, a 12-week period, and then
begin to execute finding the specific requirements for each of the features.</div>
</div>
Get some lead time before beginning the incremental deliverables so that you have
requirements ready to go for actual development, a two to three week lead time to
get some well-defined requirements. In beginning with lead time, you can execute,
on a weekly basis, staying two to three weeks ahead of the development team with very
detailed requirements that are actionable for them.
<h2>Fear the stakeholder's fears... Just don't share them</h2>
<img style="margin: 10px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/stakeholderfears.jpg" alt="Stakeholder Fears" border="0" />

It is very important to protect the backlog. When you define a small milestone, it
is very easy for some of the stakeholders to come forward to say "We should add this
in, and we should do this as well. It is really going to be critical to this, and
we don't want to paint ourselves in a corner." The concerns may be raised in anticipation
of the sixth milestone instead of an attention to the immediate milestone. You will
need to structure architecture so that you indeed don't paint yourself in a corner,
but also don't go in the opposable direction from where you need to go overall. You
still have the knowledge of where you need to go overall, but you should actively
defer the items that are not in the first milestone, because it is more important
to achieve success on the first milestone and to move on, than it is to satisfy fears
of what might happen in the sixth milestone.

Depending on the client, it may be important to have not only the backlog, which is
the approved and official feature list, but also an unbudgeted wish list for future
things, so that there is a forum where people can put in items that won't be forgotten.

Once you set the goals for a 6-week to 3-month project, any capable project manager
and or architect is going to be able to achieve success for something of that scope.
That is a very short period of time.
<h2>Legacy Systems</h2>
A lot of organizations have a legacy system or more than one legacy system that will
be replaced by a new project being undertaken. A really intelligent way to order milestone
prioritization in those situations is to dedicate, depending on the length of the
project of course, your first milestone or your first couple of milestones to only
replacing the features in the legacy system or systems that an organization wishes
to keep. There is obviously no point in rebuilding functionality that is not used
or not valuable, but for the functions that are valuable, it makes sense to replace
those as is (or with some minor modifications to the user interface or other productivity
features) and to get those into production.
<ul>
	<li>What that allows you to do is to, as is learned in driving school, separate dangers,
so you minimize the risk that the standing up of the development environment, that
enables new business processes, will be time consuming.</li>
	<li>The first milestone or milestones then essential amount to a technical upgrade wherein
the requirements of the project may be driven by the design of an existing system.
Ultimately, almost everybody would admit you are absolutely going to need the legacy
functionality to move forward, so it's better to get that out of the way early.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overcome the challenge of going to production</h2>
Then, incrementally or even on a biweekly or monthly basis, begin to release small
new feature sets to users and ease into growing the system rather than releasing a
massive amount of new functionality on one day. From a risk management standpoint,
there is just no comparison between the two approaches.
