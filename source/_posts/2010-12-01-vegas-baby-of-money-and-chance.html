We offer the following article as a follow-up to our previous posting, <a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/2010/11/24/WhatIsACodeReviewAndWhyIsItImportant.aspx" target="_blank">"What
is a code review and why is it important?"</a>

If you don't collect feedback you're never going to know if you're executing your
development plans successfully. What one is fighting with code reviews is entropy.
A system, left to its own devices, will naturally breakdown into a state of stagnation.
At <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>, we have
architecture and governing processes in place to make sure our systems remain vibrant,
alive, dynamic, and continually able to change, but without the feedback process we
run the risk of allowing chance to run the life of our systems.

Let's take a look at one of the oldest industries that we are aware of: The Finance
Industry. Money has been around for a long time and the art of keeping track of money
has been around for a long time too. That's finance.<!--more-->

The software industry, the automating of business processes and functions, is relatively
new in the grand scheme of things. In contrast, in the finance world, a lot of the
processes and practices are very mature, and reviewing "the books," reviewing financial
statements and auditing financial statements, is a common practice regardless of the
trust that we place on the people we have maintaining the books with their own companies.
<ul>
	<li>There is a standing practice that is a best practice in the financial world: You get
your books reviewed. You have a schedule for when you're going to have your books
audited and you make sure that the numbers line up... that they reconcile how you
expect them to reconcile.</li>
	<li>In the software world, that's not as much a widely expected practice, and unfortunately
the absence of review is often where things start to go wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Obvious, Easy Solution</h3>
Let's go ahead and take a look. Let's see whether the system is performing or not,
whether it is scaling or if we have huge bottlenecks in some areas. Let's do a <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/code-review/" target="_blank">code
review</a> and try to find some help for ourselves.

We may decide it is time to divest a product line or sell a software system or perhaps
purchase another company, and it could only be considered due diligence to assess
the value of the particular systems in play by way of code reviews.

I think that as the software industry matures it will adopt some of the practices
of the finance industry and software professionals will come to expect frequent code
reviews as a matter of common course and as a part of responsible software ownership.

where a code review might lead you, why not take a look?
