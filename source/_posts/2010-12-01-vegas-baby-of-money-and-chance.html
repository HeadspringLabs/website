<p>We offer the following article as a follow-up to our previous posting, <a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/2010/11/24/WhatIsACodeReviewAndWhyIsItImportant.aspx" target="_blank">"What<br />
is a code review and why is it important?"</a></p>
<p>If you don't collect feedback you're never going to know if you're executing your<br />
development plans successfully. What one is fighting with code reviews is entropy.<br />
A system, left to its own devices, will naturally breakdown into a state of stagnation.<br />
At <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>, we have<br />
architecture and governing processes in place to make sure our systems remain vibrant,<br />
alive, dynamic, and continually able to change, but without the feedback process we<br />
run the risk of allowing chance to run the life of our systems.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at one of the oldest industries that we are aware of: The Finance<br />
Industry. Money has been around for a long time and the art of keeping track of money<br />
has been around for a long time too. That's finance.<!--more--></p>

<p>The software industry, the automating of business processes and functions, is relatively<br />
new in the grand scheme of things. In contrast, in the finance world, a lot of the<br />
processes and practices are very mature, and reviewing "the books," reviewing financial<br />
statements and auditing financial statements, is a common practice regardless of the<br />
trust that we place on the people we have maintaining the books with their own companies.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a standing practice that is a best practice in the financial world: You get<br />
your books reviewed. You have a schedule for when you're going to have your books<br />
audited and you make sure that the numbers line up... that they reconcile how you<br />
expect them to reconcile.</li>
<li>In the software world, that's not as much a widely expected practice, and unfortunately<br />
the absence of review is often where things start to go wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Obvious, Easy Solution</h3>
<p>Let's go ahead and take a look. Let's see whether the system is performing or not,<br />
whether it is scaling or if we have huge bottlenecks in some areas. Let's do a <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/code-review/" target="_blank">code<br />
review</a> and try to find some help for ourselves.</p>
<p>We may decide it is time to divest a product line or sell a software system or perhaps<br />
purchase another company, and it could only be considered due diligence to assess<br />
the value of the particular systems in play by way of code reviews.</p>
<p>I think that as the software industry matures it will adopt some of the practices<br />
of the finance industry and software professionals will come to expect frequent code<br />
reviews as a matter of common course and as a part of responsible software ownership.</p>
