<h2>What Kinds of Software Projects Benefit From an Installer?</h2>
<p>So you've invested in creating a Windows application of some kind and you're ready to distribute it so others can use it.  Maybe that means making it available for sale to millions of outside people, or perhaps it means handing it off to your IT administrator.  How are the finished bits going to get to a place they can be used?</p>
<p>If your software is a client application that will live locally on the user's computer (think Microsoft Office or the latest version of Halo), you should very seriously consider creating an installer.  Back in the days of DOS and the Soviet Union the operating system was little more than a shell over a file system and the user had to explicitly go find and tell the computer to run your application.  Windows provides a start menu with a list of all the programs a user can run, and at a minimum you probably want to add entries so your users can easily find and run the software once it's on their system.</p>
<p>On the other hand if your software is a web application then there probably isn't going to be much benefit to creating an installer.  The installation is theoretically going to be done by a tech savvy individual that will be configuring the web server initially, and upgrades usually just mean copying newer files into the site directory.  The benefit of creating an installer for this process is rarely going to be exceed the cost.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't /automate/ the upgrade process.  Most Headspring projects are configured to be deployed automatically by a continuous integration server to eliminate rote error prone activity, and very large web applications (think Netflix) usually are deployed by automatically creating a virtual machine image using tooling such as Puppet, Chef, or VMWare with the application.</p>
<h2>Why Should I Bother?</h2>
<p>Why should you go through the effort of creating an installer for your Windows client application?  Lots of developer tools are distributed as a zip file that contains the software, and it's up to the person downloading it to place it on their file system somewhere and find it whenever they want to run it - what's wrong with that?</p>
<p>Installers make software accessible to casual users who might not know what to do with a zip archive.  Even if the target demographic is power users, it still makes their life easier to provide them with an installer that adds start menu entries for them.</p>
<p>Installers also allow you to ensure that certain tasks or setup activities take place by running custom actions as part of the install, minimizing the chance your application gets configured incorrectly before your client starts using it.</p>
<p>There are other less tangible but still very real benefits as well.  An installer projects a professional image of your application.  This is your users first impression of your application, and having an installer silently says "this is a polished project".</p>
