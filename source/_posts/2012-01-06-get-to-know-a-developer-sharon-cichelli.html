She is even a regular attendee and sometime presenter for a community group named <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Austin-All-Girl-Hack-Night/">Austin All-Girl Hack Night</a>.  However, there is no convincing Sharon, that in spite of her coolness, she's good at being girlie.</p>
<p>Getting to know her this week proved to be a very enjoyable experience. I wish that I could share our full conversation, but that would require a series in and of itself. Here are some highlights:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>What is your biggest accomplishment so far?<br />
</strong>With my teammate Josh Flanagan, we convinced the process-entrenched Dell IT department to let us try (and succeed with) the first sanctioned agile project at Dell. We had to convince our fellow developers (including the ones overseas), system architect, project manager, test lead and testers, business analyst, internal customers, manager, senior manager, director, and the team that governed the project management process to use Scrum instead of Waterfall for planning and tracking deliverables. We enjoyed many successful, predictable deployments and unprecedented stakeholder engagement. Most projects at Dell today use an agile project management approach.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best invention in the past 50 years?</strong><br />
Open Source and Creative Commons as a means of sharing and building upon intellectual property. For example, consider the following progression, which would have been impossible under restrictive patents: The Processing programming language, built based on Java and designed to be accessible to non-software engineers, inspires the Wiring programming language and environment, which is used by the Arduino microcontroller (which is open-source hardware), which is the brains in a MakerBot 3D printer. Because these inventions were released as open source, successive teams built new innovations, culminating in an affordable hobbyist printer that makes plastic widgets!</p>
<p><strong>What tools or technology are you really interested in?</strong><br />
The Arduino microcontroller, and open-source platform for prototyping electronics projects. I've given a few talks and hands-on hack sessions about the Arduino, written some blog posts, and I post my Arduino code to Github.</p>
<p>I'm also excited about JavaScript and CSS again. The UI layer had gotten muddled for a few years, but it is vibrant, fun, and full of potential now.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most prized possession?</strong><br />
I'm really grateful to have a house that I share with my husband. I'm growing asparagus in the backyard. Digging in the dirt makes me feel, well, grounded.</p>
<p><strong>When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong><br />
A novelist. When I was little, I didn't keep a diary; I wrote a memoir, which my nine-year-old self was certain would be published posthumously and assigned in English classes, based on the importance and emotional depth of my other published works. Dream big.</p>
