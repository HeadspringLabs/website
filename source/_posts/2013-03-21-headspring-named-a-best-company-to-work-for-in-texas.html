<p>We are ranked 8<sup>th</sup> in the Small Companies category for the 2013 Best Companies to Work for in Texas list! This list is by the Texas Association of Business and our category includes businesses that have 15-99 total employees. We are very excited about this honor and thank our awesome team for helping us make it happen!</p>
<p>The Best Companies to Work for in Texas Awards, hosted by Best Companies Inc, SHRM - Texas State Council, <i>Texas Monthly</i> and the Texas Association of Business, is designed to recognize the best employers in the state that make it a priority to create better workplaces for their employees. The list names companies with the best practices among Texas employers and recognizes them for their commitment.</p>
<p>“The Headspring team is honored to be ranked as one of the best places to work in Texas,” noted Dustin Wells, Founder and CEO of Headspring. “At Headspring, we focus on creating a company culture that supports the growth and well-being of our talented employees. We are proud that the Texas Association of Business recognized our efforts.”</p>
<p>The best companies were selected based on a survey that was released in the summer of 2012, which included an organizational overview of the company’s policies and procedures and an in-depth employee questionnaire. The entire list of rankings for the 100 Best Companies to Work for in Texas can be found in the April 2013 issue of <i>Texas Monthly</i>.</p>
