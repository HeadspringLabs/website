Apparently it’s Nolan! <!--more-->

<strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong>

I’m an expert debugger, thanks in large part to being patient and ruthlessly methodical and organized while troubleshooting.

<strong>What led you to software development?</strong>

I got a TI 99-4A computer when I was a kid, and got hooked on programming simple games in BASIC.  There was just a sense of magic in getting the computer to do my bidding, once you can figure out how to instruct it.  As I got older I could see how computer programs make people’s lives better in so many different ways, and who can walk away from doing something you find fun that makes life better?

<strong>Do you like teaching?</strong>

I enjoy helping others, and teaching is really just a specialized form of helping by expanding someone’s knowledge of how things work.  The biggest reward is seeing that “aha” moment in others when it all comes together, it’s just like seeing a set of instructions you’ve put together do something useful on a computer.

<strong>Where do you begin learning something new?</strong>

I usually try a blend of hands on practice and academic study of the fundamentals, whether it’s a new programming language or a new craft like cake baking. Hands on practice and study is important – we learn from failures, and practice makes concepts real to us.  Rote memorization doesn’t stick if you don’t exercise what you’re learning.  Hands on practice also needs to be supplemented with a sound understanding of the theoretical underpinnings, or else you won’t completely understand the “whys” of what you’re doing, or be able to see new ways to accomplish things.

<strong>When is the best time to test?</strong>

When you are building some sort of high risk functionality. Something is high risk if the consequences of failure are high – security rules, for example. Something is also high risk if the chance of introducing a defect later is high. A few examples of this would be complex business rules, long multistep calculations, or conditional logic. I’m sure there is a lot more testing in, say, the aerospace industry, than in others. It all depends on the circumstances.

Nolan went on to explain to me that he is the kind of person that is incredibly meticulous.  He posed the question, “Would you allow a computer you programmed to operate on you? I might; I don’t know. I just know that I am the kind of person that is going to be really diligent and meticulous about the details, just in case.”
