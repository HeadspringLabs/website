You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/maydaytx/DynamicLinq">Github</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, he is incredibly knowledgeable Headspring developer, and is known for his affinity for clean, elegant code.  In fact, he prefers refactoring rather than having to work around bad code.  He is also great proponent for balancing the benefit of tests without sacrificing quality.  Here’s what else I learned today:</p>

<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I’m an expert in .NET.  I’m very strong with all things technical and I usually volunteer for the difficult problems.  I’m also creative (probably because I’m left-handed), which is why software development is my passion.  I’m also an expert rock bassist.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development? What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>When I was in 10th grade, I taught myself to program my TI-86 graphing calculator during math class.  I wrote programs to solve test questions so that I could just enter the inputs, and the program would show all the steps and the answer.   I also wrote a couple of simple text-based games that I let my classmates play.  Once I realized that I liked creating the game more than playing it, I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>So what came next?</strong></p>
<p>When it was time for college I knew I wanted to major in Computer Science.  However, I  couldn’t get into the program right away because of my grades, so I started in Mechanical Engineering.  I’ve always thought that was weird. Isn’t engineering supposed to be harder?  Anyway I transferred as soon as I could into the Computer Science department.  We learned a few languages and a lot of theory, but not a lot about best practices in development.  I acquired my “skill” for development at my first job out of college in Temple at McLane Advanced Technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I take the path of least resistance.  Sometime I follow an example.  I taught myself how to play chords on the guitar by watching my dad and brother play one day.  After they left the room, I was playing along to my first Nirvana song (<em>In Bloom</em>) in no time.  Other times I read a manual.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I gauge time well spent by how much enjoyment I get.  If you don’t enjoy what you are doing and have a passion for it, it’s really just a waste of time.</p>
