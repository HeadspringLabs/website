<p>A lot of people call me up when they need custom software to solve a problem. While each project is a little bit different, they typically fall within a few categories of maintainable software solutions. I’ve learned a valuable lesson about categories though: Sometimes you have to throw them out the window to clearly understand a problem…</p>
<p>Growing up I read a lot of Calvin and Hobbes. I’ve got every anthology including the leather-bound edition. As much as I love reading them, I find myself having to refocus halfway through a single strip. I tend to think that I know the ending to a given strip or series, and I skip ahead.</p>
<p>Oh, this is the one where he collects all the UPCs and gets a propeller beanie. I’m going to flip a few pages and see the look on his face when he doesn’t take off!<!--more--></p>
<p>I always thought I had read every single Calvin and Hobbes. There was nothing about that kid and his tiger that I didn’t know.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, I was going back through my old collections and I found that I definitely hadn’t read every strip. In fact, I found that I had skipped most of the large Sunday illustrations because over the years I was skipping pages, thinking oh, I’ve read all of these storylines before.</p>
<p>It turns out those Sunday illustrations were the best. They were the ones that had cool stuff like T-Rex’s riding in fighter jets! (Spoiler alert for the shockingly Randy Quaid-less ending of Cowboys vs. Aliens).</p>
<p>I find that this same pattern shows up if I’m talking with a client who has a familiar problem. I have to focus myself on what they’re telling me so I don’t jump ahead in my mind to what I think the solution is. If I do that, I’ll miss out on all of the really important stuff they’re sharing- things that I wouldn’t have thought could be a part of the problem or answer. I want the Sunday edition of their story, I don’t want to hear the first panel and flip to my ending.</p>
<p>If a company is looking to become more agile, if they’re looking for an object-oriented development approach, or if they want us to modernize their legacy system, I have to put away my jump-to-conclusions mat- I might surprise myself and discover something I wouldn’t have found otherwise.</p>
