<p>The Austin Startup Games were a flying success this past Saturday, February 16th at the Austin Music Hall. Headspring was proud to participate for the first time!</p>
<p>The Austin Startup Games is a one-day event in which sixteen Austin companies compete in various activities, including beer pong, ping pong, shuffleboard, foosball, pop-a-shot, darts, Connect 4, trivia and flip cup. The mechanical bull was the surprise event.</p>

<p>We sported these awesome Headspring shirts. We call it "From Our Heads" because it's an abstract mash-up of the Headspring culture. It combines what we do and tools we use (bit bucket, technology, code, the cloud, mobile apps) and the things we enjoy (bowling, the Internet, providing great customer service).</p>

<p>Each company represented a charity of its choice, and Headspring chose The Cancer Connection. (link: http://www.thecancerconnection.org/) The organization provides one-on-one mentoring and oncology and hospital support to patients. The Cancer Connection volunteers provide comfort, support and informational resources to cancer patients and their families.</p>
<p>There were very intense and close competitions, and at the end of the day, Headspring walked away victoriously with a couple of medals and a proud team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Justin P. won Bronze in Connect Four</li>
<li>Chris M. and Patrick M. won Silver in Beer Pong</li>
<li>Glenn B. and Kevin H. won Bronze in Foosball</li>
</ul>

<p>Total results:</p>
<ul>
<li>533 lbs (about 480 meals) of food was donated to Capital Area Food Bank</li>
<li>500-600 attendees was expected and actually had 800 attendees show up</li>
</ul>
<p>The Austin Startup Games was a great opportunity to bring out our competitive side, represent Headspring among numerous Austin companies, support The Cancer Connection and bring our team together for some fun and bonding time.</p>
