I have never understood thrill seekers.  People who bungee off of bridges or sky dive or walk on hot coals have always confused me.  Do these people not value their life or their safety?  Most of the time, it seems to me that a thrill seeker is looking for attention, and trouble is the best way to get it.  Furthermore, what astonishes me the most about thrill seekers are their cool and carefree attitudes.  Thrill seekers often put themselves in the most dangerous situations, and yet they are generally more relaxed than Nervous Nancy who always keeps herself safe.  Why?

After watching the documentary, <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/programs/killer-stress/">National Geographic: Stress – Portrait of Killer</a></em>, I finally understand.  In fact, I may be a convert.<!--more-->

This revelatory film exposed me to the physicality of stress.  First, one must understand the biology of it all. When we become stressed out, a series of hormones in our bodies spike as we are exposed to scary or uncomfortable situations.  These hormones mobilize energy away from storage to our muscles.  Our heart rate increases, and our metabolic processes (digestion, immunity, reproduction, etc.) begin to shut down.

Essentially, animal bodies go through the same biological processes of releasing hormones when they are stressed out, only they are typically in real danger.  Visualize zebras being attacked by hyenas – now that’s real danger.  Stress hormones release, and all non-essential metabolic processes shut down, enabling the zebra to fight off its predator. What’s important to realize is that even though animals are exposed to higher levels of danger, they only experience increased levels of stress in brief intervals of only a couple minutes.

But what stresses out a human?  Mortgages, public speaking, walking down the aisle… long term stressors.  Stressors like ours can last days, weeks, sometimes even years. So we are experiencing stressful situations, over longer periods of time, and for all kinds of reasons.  Our bodies are constantly releasing stress hormones because our minds are telling us we are in life-threatening danger over $4 a gallon gasoline.  Ridiculous!
<p style="text-align: center;">Now, let’s revisit Nervous Nancy.  She recognizes how dangerous the world is, and she wants to protect herself.  However, she is in a constant state of stress, and her body’s metabolic processes are threatened by it.  Maybe she develops a stomach ulcer, and subsequently she may become more worried.  She may get irritable when she experiences obstacles that prevent her from eliminating stressors in her life.  You can imagine the many negative consequences that snowball from here.  Basically, Nervous Nancy may be safe from danger, but she’s a mess.  <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/reduce-stress-put-down-the-zoloft-and-start-base-jumping/istock_000016699925medium-2" rel="attachment wp-att-2410"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2410 aligncenter" title="iStock_000016699925Medium" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iStock_000016699925Medium1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
However, thrill seekers are more relaxed than Nervous Nancy because they are subconsciously regulating their release of stress hormones.  They put themselves in seemingly life-threatening situations in order to better differentiate appropriate levels of stress.

What really helped me understand all of this is when I put it in terms of standing heart rates.  Our standing heart rate should be low, because our bodies should not have to work hard to sit still.  The only way to reduce our standing heart is regular exercise.  I now understand that, just like when I exercise my body to reduce my standing heart rate, I should put myself in uncomfortable, thrilling situations to reduce stress levels.

This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Eleanor Roosevelt: “Do one thing a day that scares you.” I don’t think I will be strapping on a bungee cord anytime soon, but I do believe it is time to challenge myself a little more each day.

Any suggestions on what dangerous adventures I should begin to embark on?
