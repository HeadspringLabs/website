Imagine that running a business is like riding a bull in a rodeo. The straps are wrapped tight around your hands. You grin, nod, and hold on for as long as you can.  The bull bucks furiously, and if it’s ornery enough, you’ll be thrown off just as soon as you mount.  If you get the choice, maybe you would like a tamer bull, not quite as mad, so you can stay on longer.  After all, the bull is your opponent, the battle is your business, and you want to win.

Let’s explore three reasons why you really want the mad bull:
<ol>
	<li>Achieving a harder challenge yields greater reward. The trick to this metaphor is that in a rodeo, your score is calculated both by how long you are able to stay on the bull and by your selected bull’s temperament.  A mean bull will buck you off early, but he is worth more points for the challenge.  What is the risk worth to you?  Take a gamble, and you may surprise yourself.</li>
	<li>If you know your opponent will be tough, you’re more likely to prepare.  Preparing for an angry bull won’t just allow you to stay on the bull longer; it makes you a better bull rider.  Your training doesn’t disappear when the ride is over. You come out stronger and with more knowledge about how the bull moves.</li>
	<li>A healthy match spurs the opportunity for both participants to innovate.  If you have ever interviewed someone, you have probably asked them “How did you face a tough situation?”  The answer you want to hear is something honest and creative.  You need to know how this person will innovate in a challenging situation, because innovation is valuable.  Discover for yourself a new technique for staying on a mad bull longer.  Change the game!</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

You can stay on the tamer bull for a really long time, and maybe you’ll earn enough points to win.  Maybe you’ll walk away with some money, a nice belt buckle, or a pat on the back. But no one will be surprised, no one will ask you how you did it, and no one will consider you “the one to beat”.

The moral of the metaphor is, don’t back down from a good fight.  Be as brave as your inner bull rider. Find an opponent that is worthy of you.

So which bull do you want?
