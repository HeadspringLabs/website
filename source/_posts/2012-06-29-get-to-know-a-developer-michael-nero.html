<p>…New York City?! (Now, commence Pace Picante commercial re-enactment)…</p>
<p>And before all that, several years of bouncing between Beaumont and Austin for various school and work opportunities.</p>
<p>Anyway, we had a great time talking about living in New York, dirty subways, and you know, some work stuff. Here’s the rest:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I’m a good C# developer, and I know quite a lot about the .NET Framework, most specifically threading.  I’ll stop short of calling myself an expert at anything though, just so I don’t preclude the possibility that I may learn something new.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>I’m unreservedly dedicated to clients I can help the most and who’s work benefits someone other than themselves.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>It was by accident, really.  When I was younger, I really wanted to be a Microsoft Technical Support Representative, which I thought was the highest echelon of achievement – we’re all young once.  Having thwarted my mother’s attempts to make me a C++ programmer when I was freshman in high school (my version of teenage rebellion), I finally gave in to her ever present delicate pressure to pursue an Electrical Engineering degree at university.  Part of the curriculum for an EE major was a few CS classes, and in my first CS class, I learned that hey, I was pretty good at writing code.  So, I stuck with it.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>My university’s curriculum taught Managed C++ for the first year, then we moved to Java for the second year, then we were free to use whatever language we liked best after that.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>I like it when people get excited, and people are always excited about learning something new.</p>
<p><strong>What does your team rely on you for?</strong></p>
<p>My positive and no-challenge-is-too-great attitude, I hope.  My teams have always been brimming with super smart people, and alone, there’s nothing to stop any one of them.  But together, we can create something truly beautiful.  So, I guess I’m a good cheerleader.</p>
