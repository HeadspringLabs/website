<strong>Headspring promotes CTO</strong>

<strong>Austin, Texas - March 1, 2010</strong>Â - Headspring announces a promotion for Jeffrey Palermo from Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to Chief Information Officer (CIO). Jeffrey has done a great deal of work in moving Headspring forward with improved delivery standards and processes, recruiting and hiring some of the best technical minds in the industry, and building a strong technical foundation to support future needs.

A CTO is typically responsible for more tactical activities and day-to-day tasks related to managing the technology assets of an organization. While Jeffrey will continue to monitor these areas and participate from an oversight role, his skills and expertise will now be pointed towards tackling new challenges and strategic initiatives.

"Jeffrey has exceeded my expectations in what he has accomplished in his almost 3 years at Headspring," said Dustin Wells, CEO of Headspring. "We have experienced exponential growth and would not have been successful without his leadership. I am excited that he has accepted the challenge to step up into a more strategic role to allow him to focus on the strategic needs of the organization and ensure the technology investments that are made are well-aligned with long-term, strategic goals of Headspring."
