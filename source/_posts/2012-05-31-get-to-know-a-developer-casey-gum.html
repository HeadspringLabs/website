<a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/05/get-to-know-a-developer-casey-gum/headshot-1" rel="attachment wp-att-5334"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5334" title="Casey Gum" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/headshot-1.jpg" alt="Casey Gum" width="200" height="256" /></a>I'm so happy to finally have another new developer to write about!  Casey Gum just joined the team as a Principal Consultant yesterday, and so far he's doing great with jumping right in to working with clients. He's got a pretty full schedule already, but he spared me a few moments this morning.

Casey is our first new Principal Consultant at Headspring since <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/arobles" target="_blank">Alonso Robles</a> came on board in December, and boy did we need him for all the big projects we have taken on in 2012.  He comes from 8 years spent in tech consulting for military intelligence and law enforcement with Textron.  He is also one of the original founders of Austin's <a href="http://www.fg2.com/" target="_blank">FG Squared</a>.

Here's a bit of our conversation:<!--more-->

<strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong>

C# in general, Silverlight and WPF.  Other than that, I would merely categorize myself as proficient in a wide variety of technologies.

<strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong>

My ideal client is the one that can most benefit from my expertise.  As far as individuals, I like working with anyone with a good attitude and a passion for learning.

<strong>What led you to software development?</strong>

I have always loved computers. I knew from a very early age that I would be an engineer or a programmer.

<strong>What did you learn first?</strong>

The first language I learned was BASIC on a TI-99 in 1981.  I saved/loaded my (mostly Dungeons and Dragons-related) programs to a cassette tape.  Good times, good times.

<strong>Do you like teaching?</strong>

I do like teaching. I actually taught my first computer class to kids at Computerland in El Paso when I was 15.  I have taught a number of developer training sessions on Design Principles, Patterns and Practices.

<strong>What are your plans for the future?</strong>

For the next 10-12 years, I am going to do everything I can to prepare my children for a career in engineering. We need more engineers.
