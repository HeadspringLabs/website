<p>Software development is very different from physical engineering projects. In building<br />
a bridge, first of all, one needs to span a valley or a river in some fashion to set<br />
a foundation from the start of the bridge to the end of the bridge, followed by building<br />
some scaffolding and layering on asphalt. There is a specific order that you need<br />
to build horizontal layers in because of the physical materials that you're working<br />
with, and not a single car can drive across the bridge until you at least have one<br />
lane of asphalt poured and the bridge stable. Software, in contrast, has very different<br />
physical materials to such an extent that the "materials" aren't really physical at<br />
all. (It's computer behavior.)</p>
<p>This gives us a possibility that is perhaps a little bit hard to understand at first.<br />
That is the possibility that we need not construct the software in horizontal layers<br />
and that we instead have the option to construct software in vertical slices. Imagine<br />
if a custom home builder could create the master bedroom of your new house, get the<br />
electricity working along with the plumbing and lighting, and even finish the sheetrock<br />
and painting allowing you to start sleeping in your master bedroom when not even the<br />
concrete slab for the rest of your home is yet poured. Such a master bedroom would<br />
be a vertical slice of your home. While the materials don't allow this approach in<br />
home construction, it is absolutely possible in software construction.<!--more--></p>
<div style="height: 450px;"><img style="margin: 2px 0px; float: left;" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/buildvertically.gif" alt="build vertically" border="0" /></p>
<div style="width: 345px; float: right; height: 440px;">
<p>An order processing system which will be used by people who oversee taking orders,<br />
a shipping department that is going to ship the orders, and an inventory department<br />
that is going to react to the orders (and keep itself stocked by ordering from a distributor<br />
or manufacturer) can serve as a good example for illustrating the practical application<br />
of vertical construction. Assume that the business either doesn't have existing software<br />
or that each department has an isolated system and that while the business is not<br />
as efficient as it could be it is nonetheless operational. In the name of a companywide<br />
system it would be a workable solution to first bring up maybe just an inventory system,<br />
or the first few critical features of an inventory application, for just the inventory<br />
department to start using. The sales department and the shipping department would<br />
continue on with their current processes and they wouldn't benefit from any new software<br />
for a time, but one set of users in the inventory department would be able to start<br />
deriving business value from the features delivered.</p>
<ul>
<li>The software isn't done. It's not anywhere near completion, but it can start providing<br />
value to the business.</li>
<li>It can start providing a return on a portion of the investment far before you even<br />
get halfway done with the entire system.</li>
<li>The "materials" give us a lot of flexibility for achieving a return on investment<br />
much sooner than so in physical engineering or construction projects.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>The process may allow you to mitigate some risk. It is common and correct that once<br />
a piece of software is developed that it is released and used a little bit (whether<br />
it is in testing or actually piloted) to vet sooner rather than later when all the<br />
other pieces may work off of it or meet the particular feature. You've got a key piece<br />
of functionality you may actually use to see if it is going to suffice and if it embodies<br />
the characteristics and goals you stated in the specifications.</p>
<p>You also have the ability to check an overall vision against it and say:</p>
<div style="background-image: url('http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/discussion.gif'); padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 24px; padding-left: 15px; width: 203px; padding-right: 243px; height: 447px; color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 9px;">
<div>"This is very important, but I think we're going to be going this way instead."</div>
</div>
<p>Maybe a new process or some other interesting constraints have come into the business<br />
altering course. Maybe the company has acquired another company in the process of<br />
the development and thus processes may need to work a little bit differently and thus<br />
the stakeholders can see that in front of them and say:</p>
<div style="background-image: url('http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/insight.gif'); padding-bottom: 0px; line-height: 24px; padding-left: 171px; width: 203px; padding-right: 215px; height: 420px; color: #ffffff; font-size: 18px; padding-top: 9px;">
<div>"Ah, here is where we need to modify things so let's go ahead and bring that<br />
in right now."</div>
</div>
<p>That might be something that could be much more difficult or costly to do later in<br />
the game when you have a number of other pieces in play and the production code is<br />
close to a full-fledged product.</p>
<h2>Going back to the house analogy...</h2>
<p>Should I build my bedroom picture perfect, putting in the ceiling fan, the crown molding,<br />
the fancy mirrors, and the fancy bed spreads, before I build my kitchen?</p>
<p>One can do it that way or one can build out the bedroom just enough to start sleeping<br />
there. In software it really depends on the business theme. For instance, if the goal<br />
is to get the inventory department up and running punctually, managing suppliers with<br />
much paperwork, and there is a real need to automate the tasks, the requirements can<br />
be met in a barebones fashion just to solve the immediate pain point before immediately<br />
turning on order processing for a product catalog. Alternatively, if one were to start<br />
with an online catalog before going on to an inventory system, one may decide that,<br />
because the online product catalog is public-facing and is going to be an interface<br />
point with customers, that it is best to put in all the bells and whistles to make<br />
the online catalog look really polished, putting in all of the usability features<br />
so that customers have the best experience possible moving through your product catalogue<br />
in an effort to encourage purchasing by giving them the confidence that they are dealing<br />
with a reputable vendor. So depending on the business scene one may decide to put<br />
in crown molding and all of the trimmings or that it is a better use of money just<br />
to put up basic sheet rock in the bedroom for a while and invest in some other areas,<br />
getting those functional, before coming back to the bedroom to put on some finishing<br />
touches.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 2px 0px 12px 10px; float: right;" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/flexibility.jpg" alt="flexibility" border="0" /></p>
<p>Because the materials are so pliable, you have the flexibility in software to decide<br />
and determine where you are going to get the best return on investment dollars and<br />
the way in which you spend those dollars.</p>
<p>But, isn't it dangerous to change software in going back and adding on other features<br />
afterwards? Isn't it typical to see problems introduced when retouching software that<br />
has been working for a little while?</p>
<h2>The Clay Analogy</h2>
<p>If you build with clay that dries quickly, when you try to change it later it's going<br />
to crack, but if you build in such a way that the structure remains flexible and you<br />
use a higher quality clay that doesn't dry into a brittle, fragile artifact, then<br />
you can custom flex it.</p>
<h2>Now how do these analogies turn into reality?</h2>
<p>It's your software engineering technique. The materials require software engineering<br />
to be kept so flexible and so pliable.</p>
<p>It's different from civil engineering where we value rigidity. (We value a strong<br />
foundation. We value those steel I-beams that are going to resist bending and are<br />
going to stand for decades to come.) In software we loathe rigidity. We loathe those<br />
features that cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Without touching too heavily on technical terms, there is a principal called the Open-Closed<br />
Principal which specifies a method by which the behavior of a system can be changed<br />
and modified without having to rip out other pieces of code. This is an example of<br />
a specific technique that can be employed within a software engineering team that<br />
allows a team to continually modify the behavior of the software over time without<br />
having to demolish the kitchen to change the kitchen's cabinets.</p>
<p>Software is very interesting because the materials are so different from those of<br />
the physical world, and it does require a trained engineer to use the materials well.</p>
