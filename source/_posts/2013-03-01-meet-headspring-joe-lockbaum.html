<p style="text-align: left;">In January, we welcomed Joe Lockbaum to the Business Development department of the Headspring Team. Joe moved to Austin from New Jersey in the summer of 2012 for our wonderful weather -- “You don’t have to shovel heat!” Moving with his wife, Joe was excited to continue his career in the great Texas economy and in a great city. In addition to working at Headspring, Joe is in the process of starting a gym.</p>

<p>I worked for Bloomberg, a financial data and news provider, for 12 years. The first 9 years were spent in several roles selling and building the Professional software for financial professionals.  The last 3 years were spent in Enterprise Products group, selling real-time feeds and data management products to the largest clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What attracted you to work at Headspring?</b></p>
<p>The people. There are a lot of software firms in Austin, and my experience made the industry a good fit.  But the culture and the people I met through the interview process with Headspring, and being part of a team of very smart people – people clearly much smarter than me - makes me feel good about where I’m sitting, and very confident I made the right choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How do you gauge “time well spent?”</b></p>
<p>I’m extremely numbers-oriented and methodical. I find gratification in building something out of my efforts and seeing the results in dollars and cents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What role do you play at Headspring?</b></p>
<p>Pretty simple, really, my role at Headspring includes prospecting, reaching out to potential clients, and bringing those clients in the door. Whatever I can do to put projects on the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What do you hope to accomplish professionally and personally in the next 5 years?</b></p>
<p>Professionally, I want to help grow Headspring by bringing in new business. I want to put Headspring in a difficult position by bringing in so much business that the company doesn’t know what to do with it all. I also want to become a principal leader in the company. On a personal level, my wife and I are looking forward to starting a family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?</b></p>
<p>I love talking to random people to hear their stories – about how they spend their time and how they make money. When my wife and I go out to eat, we always sit at the bar and talk to every single person that walks through the door. We like to engage multiple people and try to get the whole bar talking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite places are airport bars. There are some really great people with some really amazing stories to tell.  One time, at the Heathrow airport, I started talking to someone in the first-class lounge (where you tend to meet very interesting and accomplished people). He said he liked to tell people he owned a company called Royal Ice and that he sold chunks of glaciers to Saudi princes in the desert. He then told me he really leased jets to corporate executives. We had a great laugh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What’s something you can’t live without?</b></p>
<p>Other than my phone – definitely my gym bag.  I like working out and lifting; it’s my ‘me’ time.  It’s an opportunity to shut down my mind for a little bit.  I get some of my better ideas/plans when I’m able to clear my mind of the noise.</p>
