As you may have gathered from <a title="Why try vi" href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/why-try-vi-part-1">my last post</a>, I am a big fan of vi/vim.  However, one thing that has always annoyed me about vi is that to get back into normal mode, you have to hit the escape key.  It is probably one of the most difficult keys to hit on the whole keyboard and many laptop keyboard layouts have made it about the size of peanut.

People who have been doing command-line linux for a long time don’t have a problem with this since environmental adaptation has elongated their left pinkies [citation needed].  People who use Windows and OSX, on the other hand, need help.

So, the natural thing to do is to commandeer the enormous and conveniently located Caps Lock key and make it act like the escape key.  (<strong>Note:  </strong>If you need to type OMG LOL ROFL, you can just hold down the shift key and type – you don’t actually need to use Caps Lock – just saying…)

Here's how you do it... <!--more-->

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>In Windows:</strong></span></span>

<strong>Note: </strong>If you are running Windows in Parallels on a Mac, this won’t work – go to the section on how to do it in OSX.

Take the block of text below and copy it into notepad.  Then, save the file as EscapeKeyRemap.reg and double-click it to run it.  (You can also <strong>Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit</strong> and then choose <strong>File &gt; Import</strong> and import the file.)  As you can easily see,  it sets the "Scancode Map" key to a bunch of random numbers.  This causes the Caps Lock key to behave like an escape key, which is all that really matters.
<div style="font-size: 10px;padding: 10px;border: solid 1px gray;background-color: silver">

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,01,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00

</div>
<strong>EDIT</strong>: The previous registry key entry was wrong - I fixed it.

After you have modified the registry, you will need to reboot the system.  Once you are done rebooting, you will be good to go.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>In OSX:</strong></span>

In OSX, you will need to install <strong>PCKeyboardHack</strong>.  You can download it from here: <a href="http://download.cnet.com/PCKeyboardHack/3000-2110_4-75363152.html">http://download.cnet.com/PCKeyboardHack/3000-2110_4-75363152.html</a>.

After you download and run the disk image (.dmg file) you will see an icon on your desktop called <strong>PCKeyboardHack-7.4.0</strong>.  Double-click it and it will open a new window with a file in it called <strong>PCKeyboardHack.reg</strong>.  Double-click that to install it using all the default options.  After it is done installing, you will need to reboot.

After rebooting, go to your system preferences and double-click the <strong>PCKeyboardHack</strong> icon.

<a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/power-to-the-pinkies/screen-shot-2012-06-12-at-8-40-29-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-5476"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5476" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-12-at-8.40.29-PM-300x251.png" alt="" width="300" height="251" /></a>

This will bring up a dialog that allows you to remap your Caps Lock key.  Check the Change Caps Lock box and enter the keycode <strong>53</strong>.

<a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/power-to-the-pinkies/screen-shot-2012-06-12-at-8-42-59-pm" rel="attachment wp-att-5477"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5477" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-12-at-8.42.59-PM-300x294.png" alt="" width="300" height="294" /></a>

Close the dialog and you’ll be good to go.  This will carry over to Windows running under Parallels as well.

Happy Vimming!
