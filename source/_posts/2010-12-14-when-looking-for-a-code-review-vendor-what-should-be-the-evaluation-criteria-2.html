This is never just a technical effort. This is never just a business effort. This
is never just a coaching effort. This is a process of bringing all of these elements
to bear in order to make targeted assessments and recommendations to achieve specific
goals.

The ideal vendor should have a demonstrated history of being able to guide their customers
through the improvement process and be someone who not only finds issues but who can
also make recommendations and then can also take those recommendations and actually
help you act on them to really achieve the goal you set out for in the first place.

You also have to look at the alignment that the vendor has to your way of doing business.
Obviously, you would select a different vendor if you have a market cap of several
billion dollars versus having a small company where you must make payroll for twenty
folks.

Also the type of software matters because it takes a different type of person to assess
a system that perhaps runs a high traffic ecommerce website with a backend order management
system than it does an internal system for a local livestock show and rodeo. The two
have very different characteristics, and few companies have as broad a range of consultants
as is needed to be able to serve every end of the spectrum and all the different points
in between. At <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>,
we certainly are not a good fit for everyone, and we certainly don't have the capability
to evaluate every system that exists out in the wild.<!--more-->

But when looking for a vendor, keep that in mind. Be able to describe the type of
environment you are in, and, for some, ask for a description of their previous engagements
and try to find out what similarities you have with their previous clients. Really
drill down to see if there is a fit, because not every vendor will be a fit.
<ul>
	<li>For us, not every client is a fit. We recognize that, and we value our evaluation
of clients just as much as we encourage the client's evaluation of us.</li>
	<li>After determining that there is a great fit, the likelihood of success is really great.</li>
</ul>
