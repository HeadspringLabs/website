Or a view out the window that is more scenic than an asphalt parking lot? If not, you could be leaving creativity behind.</p>
<p>I've been reading "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/59-Seconds-Little-Change-Borzoi/dp/0307273407">59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot</a>" by Psychologist and author Richard Wiseman. The book contains a firehose of fascinating research studies and conclusions aimed to help change your life in under a minute. One passage goes on to detail how much of an impact greenery can have on your workplace productivity.</p>
<blockquote><p>"An eight-month study of creativity in the workplace conducted by Robert Ulrich at Texas A&amp;M University showed that adding flowers and plants to an office resulted in a 15 percent increase in ideas from male employees and more flexible solutions to problems from their female counterparts."<!--more--></p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Wiseman (what a name, huh?) goes on to discuss several other studies including one done by Andrew Elliot at the University of Rochester that compared creativity levels of people in rooms of different color, where green walls were a clear winner over red. If you don't want to read the book, a quick Google search will yield a plentiful amount of information on the benefits of plants and the color green (like this <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2002499/Stressed-work-Put-pot-plants-desk.html">one</a>).</p>
<p>So now that you're convinced, why does greeneryÂ  have such an effect? According to Wiseman, evolutionary psychologiests suggest that centuries ago when humans lived amid healthy trees and plants it resulted in a sense of comfort and calm because it meant food was nearby. And pleasant feelings make people more helpful, happy and creative. Hard to argue that.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, several studies agree: a plant in your office would do you some good. Do you have plants in your office? Why or why not?</p>
