Logan Turner graduated in May 2011 from Grace Academy in Georgetown, Texas. Instead of taking the summer off to go on vacations, spend time with friends and sleep in like most teenagers, Logan decided to get an internship before going off to college. Currently a freshman at LeTourneau University, <!--more-->Logan interned with us at Headspring this summer to learn the ins and outs of being a business software consultant and to prepare for his future career as an engineer.

Logan is a bright and ambitious student who wanted a more technical and career-oriented summer experience before he went off to college in the fall. After acing a technical interviewing process filled with several interviews and tests, Logan began a beneficial summer of learning how to improve his programming skills. As a productive member of the team, Logan assisted on multiple projects and was able to put what he knew into practice and learn what this career path looks like from our employees.

We’re looking forward to seeing Logan develop his skills in the next few years and starting a successful career!

Logan’s school, Grace Academy, also wrote a great <a href="http://www.graceacademy-gt.org/index.php/ga-graduate-internship" target="_blank">article about his internship</a>.
