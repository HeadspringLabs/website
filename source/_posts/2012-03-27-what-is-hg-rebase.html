<p>A couple weeks ago I introduced a client developer I'm working with on a project to <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension">Hg Rebase</a> because the work we were doing at the time didn't really need feature branches of any kind. When I was asked how this works over the phone, I explained it the best I could on the spot, but here's a better attempt.</p>
<h3><strong>Rebase vs Merge</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of adding several changesets and committing them on top as a "merge" commit, Rebase uses graft (essentially a cherry-pick in the git world). My typical workflow includes taking an entirely new branch and place it "on top" of another branch. After this is done, it looks more like a straight line instead of something that has been braided. As you can see by the three diagrams below. A rebase removes the unnecessary merge commit and gives you a cleaner history. This tends to be easier for people to follow and understand than the messes you can end up with after loads of merge commits all over the place.</p>

<p>If you're interested in looking at the extension's code, it can be found on BitBucket at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/astratto/rebase-soc/">https://bitbucket.org/astratto/rebase-soc/</a>. I'm glad I was asked the question about how rebase works. Learning the internal details was really helpful for me and hopefully for you too!</p>
