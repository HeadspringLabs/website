Not everybody agrees on the definition of what a legacy system is. If a system is
legacy, how is working with it any different from working with something that is not
legacy? And, what is the opposite of legacy?

I think it can be simply stated that a legacy system is a system where one cannot
go in and make sweeping changes or enhancements easily. Maybe there is still a development
team committed to enhancing that system, but when one asks them to change or enhance
the system they give really high time estimates for doing so or they just don't want
to have anything to do with the system. It is easier to code around that system than
it is to go into the system and make sweeping changes.

When you can't get your own people to work effectively on a system, they naturally
look to you for a solution, and if there is a vendor that can provide a legacy system
upgrade or a legacy system conversion, that is an attractive solution, allowing you
to put a price tag on converting the legacy system to something modern that is much
easier to work with and enhance.
<h2>Why rewrite a legacy system if it works?<!--more--></h2>
I would say, in speaking to reasons for outsourcing the rewrite of a legacy system,
that the fact that one has a legacy system in my mind means that one can no longer
make the changes needed to make the system improve the way one does business or to
support business operations. If you can't improve your existing system you need a
new one.

<h3>The only remaining question is: "Who builds it?"</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If you don't have a vendor qualified to build a maintainable piece of software, you're
probably not better off outsourcing than you would be building internally, unless
(the only other caveat there is) you simply don't have the staff to do the kind of
work and don't want to hire people on a temporary basis for a project that may last
3, 6 or 12 months.</li>
	<li>If the internal staff you have built your first system that had to essentially be
thrown away after a certain period of time because it could no longer be modified,
then having a company with more expertise in building maintainable software facilitate
your rewrite may be an attractive option.
<ul>
	<li>Of course, every potential vendor for a legacy system rewrite is going to say that
they're qualified, so, as the hiring company, how do you select a vendor? How do you
measure candidates? What do you look for?</li>
	<li>Every vendor is going to say <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">"Oh yeah,
we can do that. We can absolutely do that."</span></strong> How do you sort through
it? That is tough. I think it is true in any industry or trade that there are people
who are experts in what they do and people who are not and that both will claim to
offer outstanding results, so as a consumer, as a purchaser, you always have to be
able to evaluate quality through some sort of evaluation or interviewing process.</li>
	<li>One of the things that sets apart quality software vendors from those of less quality
is their capability to automate the testing of the software they build. (One of the
reasons you may no longer be able to reliably change legacy software is that you simply
don't have the staff to fully test the system after you've made changes to it. In
the strictest sense, you could have any of your developers change it, but you won't
get the results that you want as things start breaking or you put the revised system
into production and the end-of-the-month reports somehow don't work or are botched.
When you change things you don't have any confidence that something seemingly unrelated
has not been broken.)</li>
	<li>A great thing to ask when interviewing vendors is: "In what way will you automate
the quality assurance of the product moving forward?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
A legacy system begins being called a legacy system after changes are made to it which
introduce major defects, and, over the course of several of these types of events,
management will begin to assume, and rightfully so, that the system cannot be reliably
changed and it moves from being a living asset for the company into being something
which will stagnate and be left behind essentially. That is when an organization moves
to the conclusion that it needs a rewrite which brings back the question of how to
select a vendor.
<h2>What is the vendor's plan and how are they going to do it?</h2>
The worst thing a vendor can do is to say "Oh yeah, we'll build you a new system"
and follow through by building a brand new system that their client loves up until
the project's release when 95% of the budget has been consumed and the vendor offers:
"Okay, now we're going to switch the other system off, and we're going to switch new
one on. We're just going to the move the data over in a quick beta conversion, and
then we'll be in production and we'll shoot off fireworks." That doesn't happen. It
just doesn't. You'll switch the old system off and the new one on and there will be
complications.

<h2>You can't burn up the whole budget just on developing a new system.</h2>
You have to have budget for implementation and dealing with the transition.

The approach that we prefer is to grow software and not build software, and that is
not just Headspring's idea. Fred Brooks penned it in his book The Mythical Man Month.
It is a decades old idea. Grow software instead of building it, so you already have
some software from doing a legacy conversion in early stages. We like to grow a new
"rewrite" system from the legacy system and ease it out of its legacy status. (The
worst thing to do is build something from scratch and then expect the pieces all to
come together at the very end in a big bang.)
<h3>In terms of selecting a vendor:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can never overlook the importance of reputation and references from other people
that have been happy with the vendor's service. That's true in any field that you
might hire somebody to do a job.</li>
	<li>Beyond that, the plan a vendor puts out is telling.
<ul>
	<li>To not know or see the results of your budget until very late in the game is a problem,
and even to dedicate, if you have an overall budget for solving a particular problem
in your business, a large percentage of a budget before you see what you really have
product-wise is a problem, and although that sounds obvious it happens almost in every
project.</li>
	<li>Let's say you have almost a $500,000 project. You don't want to spend the entire $500,000
budget before you see any return on your investment. You'd rather spend $50,000 dollars
of the budget to get a piece of the software that you may put in production and begin
to leverage and get value from. Then move on, and spend the next $50,000, and so on
and so forth (which is the way we prefer to do software development).</li>
	<li>When you hire a company like <a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>,
you'll find out within the first 10% of your budget whether or not we can add value,
and that is something you should insist on from all of the vendors you work with because
most will otherwise come up with a plan that consumes your entire budget and offers
a certain end date upon which you discover whether or not your budget solved your
business problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
