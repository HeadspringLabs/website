<p>Not everybody agrees on the definition of what a legacy system is. If a system is<br />
legacy, how is working with it any different from working with something that is not<br />
legacy? And, what is the opposite of legacy?</p>
<p>I think it can be simply stated that a legacy system is a system where one cannot<br />
go in and make sweeping changes or enhancements easily. Maybe there is still a development<br />
team committed to enhancing that system, but when one asks them to change or enhance<br />
the system they give really high time estimates for doing so or they just don't want<br />
to have anything to do with the system. It is easier to code around that system than<br />
it is to go into the system and make sweeping changes.</p>
<p>When you can't get your own people to work effectively on a system, they naturally<br />
look to you for a solution, and if there is a vendor that can provide a legacy system<br />
upgrade or a legacy system conversion, that is an attractive solution, allowing you<br />
to put a price tag on converting the legacy system to something modern that is much<br />
easier to work with and enhance.</p>
<h2>Why rewrite a legacy system if it works?<!--more--></h2>
<p>I would say, in speaking to reasons for outsourcing the rewrite of a legacy system,<br />
that the fact that one has a legacy system in my mind means that one can no longer<br />
make the changes needed to make the system improve the way one does business or to<br />
support business operations. If you can't improve your existing system you need a<br />
new one.</p>

<h3>The only remaining question is: "Who builds it?"</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you don't have a vendor qualified to build a maintainable piece of software, you're<br />
probably not better off outsourcing than you would be building internally, unless<br />
(the only other caveat there is) you simply don't have the staff to do the kind of<br />
work and don't want to hire people on a temporary basis for a project that may last<br />
3, 6 or 12 months.</li>
<li>If the internal staff you have built your first system that had to essentially be<br />
thrown away after a certain period of time because it could no longer be modified,<br />
then having a company with more expertise in building maintainable software facilitate<br />
your rewrite may be an attractive option.</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, every potential vendor for a legacy system rewrite is going to say that<br />
they're qualified, so, as the hiring company, how do you select a vendor? How do you<br />
measure candidates? What do you look for?</li>
<li>Every vendor is going to say <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">"Oh yeah,<br />
we can do that. We can absolutely do that."</span></strong> How do you sort through<br />
it? That is tough. I think it is true in any industry or trade that there are people<br />
who are experts in what they do and people who are not and that both will claim to<br />
offer outstanding results, so as a consumer, as a purchaser, you always have to be<br />
able to evaluate quality through some sort of evaluation or interviewing process.</li>
<li>One of the things that sets apart quality software vendors from those of less quality<br />
is their capability to automate the testing of the software they build. (One of the<br />
reasons you may no longer be able to reliably change legacy software is that you simply<br />
don't have the staff to fully test the system after you've made changes to it. In<br />
the strictest sense, you could have any of your developers change it, but you won't<br />
get the results that you want as things start breaking or you put the revised system<br />
into production and the end-of-the-month reports somehow don't work or are botched.<br />
When you change things you don't have any confidence that something seemingly unrelated<br />
has not been broken.)</li>
<li>A great thing to ask when interviewing vendors is: "In what way will you automate<br />
the quality assurance of the product moving forward?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A legacy system begins being called a legacy system after changes are made to it which<br />
introduce major defects, and, over the course of several of these types of events,<br />
management will begin to assume, and rightfully so, that the system cannot be reliably<br />
changed and it moves from being a living asset for the company into being something<br />
which will stagnate and be left behind essentially. That is when an organization moves<br />
to the conclusion that it needs a rewrite which brings back the question of how to<br />
select a vendor.</p>
<h2>What is the vendor's plan and how are they going to do it?</h2>
<p>The worst thing a vendor can do is to say "Oh yeah, we'll build you a new system"<br />
and follow through by building a brand new system that their client loves up until<br />
the project's release when 95% of the budget has been consumed and the vendor offers:<br />
"Okay, now we're going to switch the other system off, and we're going to switch new<br />
one on. We're just going to the move the data over in a quick beta conversion, and<br />
then we'll be in production and we'll shoot off fireworks." That doesn't happen. It<br />
just doesn't. You'll switch the old system off and the new one on and there will be<br />
complications.</p>

<h2>You can't burn up the whole budget just on developing a new system.</h2>
<p>You have to have budget for implementation and dealing with the transition.</p>
<p>The approach that we prefer is to grow software and not build software, and that is<br />
not just Headspring's idea. Fred Brooks penned it in his book The Mythical Man Month.<br />
It is a decades old idea. Grow software instead of building it, so you already have<br />
some software from doing a legacy conversion in early stages. We like to grow a new<br />
"rewrite" system from the legacy system and ease it out of its legacy status. (The<br />
worst thing to do is build something from scratch and then expect the pieces all to<br />
come together at the very end in a big bang.)</p>
<h3>In terms of selecting a vendor:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can never overlook the importance of reputation and references from other people<br />
that have been happy with the vendor's service. That's true in any field that you<br />
might hire somebody to do a job.</li>
<li>Beyond that, the plan a vendor puts out is telling.
<ul>
<li>To not know or see the results of your budget until very late in the game is a problem,<br />
and even to dedicate, if you have an overall budget for solving a particular problem<br />
in your business, a large percentage of a budget before you see what you really have<br />
product-wise is a problem, and although that sounds obvious it happens almost in every<br />
project.</li>
<li>Let's say you have almost a $500,000 project. You don't want to spend the entire $500,000<br />
budget before you see any return on your investment. You'd rather spend $50,000 dollars<br />
of the budget to get a piece of the software that you may put in production and begin<br />
to leverage and get value from. Then move on, and spend the next $50,000, and so on<br />
and so forth (which is the way we prefer to do software development).</li>
<li>When you hire a company like <a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>,<br />
you'll find out within the first 10% of your budget whether or not we can add value,<br />
and that is something you should insist on from all of the vendors you work with because<br />
most will otherwise come up with a plan that consumes your entire budget and offers<br />
a certain end date upon which you discover whether or not your budget solved your<br />
business problem.</li>
</ul>
