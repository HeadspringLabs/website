<p><em>New Space Will Preserve Culture While Expanding Staff Levels and Service Offerings </em></p>
<p><strong>AUSTIN, TX – April 9 , 2012</strong>, Headspring, an Austin-based custom software consultancy, will triple their square footage as they move into a new office space in the Avalon Building, located in northwest Austin.  As the privately funded company continues to contract new and larger projects, they vow to preserve a fun and collaborative culture, while planning to hire two new employees per month in 2012.<img title="More..." src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>The signed lease comes on the tails of President Jeffrey Palermo’s search to satisfy all employee requests for new office amenities.  “It is important that we continue to foster a creative and collaborative environment for our consultants.  I solicited requests from the team - from natural lighting, to nearby eateries, to covered parking.  I even mapped out the most ideal commute according to everyone’s residential address,” said Palermo.</p>
<p>Headspring continues to attract the attention of Texas companies, large and small, after experiencing monumental growth in 2011, which included 47 percent growth in revenue and 162 percent increase in clients.  As a result, the company is in the process of promoting current employees – five promotions so far in 2012 – and increasing staff levels by hiring two new full time positions each month.</p>
<p>“We are really looking forward to this move. A larger space means we can offer more to our team members, clients, and community,” says CEO Dustin Wells. “Expanding allows us to reach more people on our mission to solve the hardest problems and provide the most maintainable software solutions.”</p>
<p>As Headspring leads the way in project consulting and developer training, its new space, which went from 4,233 sq ft. to 11,319 sq. ft., will contain eight conference rooms for project teams to host clients and utilize as presentation and meeting space.  Also, the training room will seat up to 100 people, allowing instructors to offer the acclaimed educational courses to a larger audience, and more space for employees to host community events. Headspring’s first training session in the new office space will be its HTML5 Boot Camp open to developers nationwide.</p>
