He joined the Headspring team in 2010 looking for opportunities to enhance the user experience on projects across several clients each year.  When I have talked to other consultants, they all say Justin is really relied on for his unique ability to empathize with the client.  Here is how our conversation about web development went:<!--more-->

<strong>You have done the most Brown Bag Lunch Presentations out of all our developers.  Which one was your favorite?</strong>

The one I did on Fluent Validation.  I called it “Conquering Complex Client Crud”.  It was the first time I took a new skill, one that I had not already been using for years, and shared it right away.  I knew about ¾ of it, and learned the rest specifically so that I could better answer any questions.  It drove me to dig deep into understanding the source code and its limitations.

<strong>Do you like teaching?</strong>

I love teaching!  In college, I considered becoming a high school computer science or math teacher because I enjoy teaching and have a natural talent for it.  I decided not to, because I didn’t want to deal with rebellious students who didn’t want to be in class. At Headspring, teaching boot camps is one of my favorite things to do because all the developers are excited to be there and ready to learn.

<strong>What are your plans for the future?</strong>

I want to have a start up one day and significantly change something about the world.  I’ve found with technology, it’s easy for a great idea like mint.com, or legalzoom.com, or meetup.com to improve the quality of life for people, and I want to make a similar impact on the world.

<strong>What do you wish the industry cared more about?</strong>

I wish my peers – other developers at other companies – cared more about ROI.  A lot of times I see other developers get caught up in rules and absolutes, rather than seeing the big picture.  For example, this can happen a lot with testing.  Sometimes, a developer will write an entire test for something, just in case it needs to be refactored.  But refactoring might be unlikely, and if it is, the person executing may think the test is garbage and throw it out.  Yes, testing is important, but what is the ROI on the time it takes to create a test that might or might not be used by some other operator in the future?

<strong>What do you like most about front-end development?</strong>

I like creating an efficient workflow, and a lot of times you can get the easiest returns on improving the front-end experience.  There is always room for improvement that immediate impacts the user.
