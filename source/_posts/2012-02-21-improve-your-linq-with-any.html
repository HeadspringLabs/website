<p>LINQ's <code>.Any()</code> method is under-utilized, given the benefits it brings in making your code briefer, clearer, and more efficient. LINQ in general improves the expressiveness of your collection-manipulating code by using declarative statements instead of imperative <code>foreach</code> loops; <code>.Any()</code> is a great tool in that regard.</p>
<p>Here's a representative example:</p>
<p>{% gist 1877234 %}</p>
<p>I want to determine if my to-do list has any items that are late, so I use <code>.Where()</code> to filter my list of deliverables down to items with a deadline in the past; then I take a <code>.Count()</code> of the resulting list, and see if that number is greater than zero. This is a plausible solution, and our years of SQL lead us to write LINQ this way. But it can be better.<!--more--></p>
<p>Testing "count greater than zero" is a programmer's way of saying "are there any?" So let's just say <em>any</em>. As you might expect, <code>.Any()</code> returns a Boolean indicating whether the collection contains any items. Further, you can pass a lambda expression to specify the predicate "any <em>like this</em>." (<code>.Count()</code> takes a predicate, too, by the way, but I really have seen "<code>.Where().Count()</code>" in use, so I wanted to start from there.)</p>
<p>Here's the new version:</p>
<p>{% gist 1877236 %}</p>
<p>In addition to being shorter, this version more directly and declaratively states my intent: "Are there any late deliverables?"</p>
<p>This code also executes more efficiently. For <code>.Count()</code> to return a value, LINQ must iterate over all items in the collection, even though I don't care <em>how many</em> items there are. <code>.Any()</code> will return as soon as it encounters an item that satisfies the predicate. It evaluates as few items as possible, giving me an efficient and readable solution.</p>
