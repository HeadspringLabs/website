<p>It's very important to reflect on why you're asking for a <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/code-review/" target="_blank">code<br />
review</a>. In the tactical sense, you could say "Oh, I'm looking at individual lines<br />
of code," but rarely is that what is really important. More often than not, it is<br />
business goals that you're measuring against when you have a particular system you<br />
want to evaluate. Often, there is a need for an inspection of a particular system<br />
to see what is "going on" and what the likely challenges are. It's in production now,<br />
it's working, and it's suiting the business, but is there something lurking around<br />
the corner that we don't understand?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">Potentially Relevant Questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Is the system healthy?</li>
<li>Is it going to satisfy performance and scalability needs for the next year, 2 years,<br />
5, 10 years?</li>
<li>How long is this system likely to live?</li>
<li>Technology is going to come and go. What are our risks around that?</li>
<li>In general, what could go wrong?<!--more--></li>
</ul>
<p>An experienced code reviewer, you can call them a system inspector, an auditor, or<br />
a program reviewer, is going to inspect the system in a code review and additionally<br />
an artifact of the code itself, the documentation. (Systems come with varying degrees<br />
of documentation, and of those that have documentation the codifications are in varying<br />
degrees of correctness, some more out of date than others.) Evaluating a system and<br />
doing a code review goes all the way from looking at a system from an architectural<br />
level (the modularity versus the integrated nature of the system) down to perhaps<br />
looking at the way a particular routine was implemented to look for performance and<br />
security characteristics. There is a whole gamut for what one might want to look for<br />
depending on what the business goals are.</p>

<div style="width: 310px; height: 300px; float: left;"><img title="Development Manager" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/developmentmanager.jpg" alt="Development Manager" border="0" /><strong>If you're a development manager</strong> and you have a team of programmers,<br />
perhaps you want to make sure that your programmers are righting secure code and writing<br />
code that is going to perform well or be scalable to a high load with predictable<br />
performance.</div>
<div style="width: 310px; height: 300px; float: right; text-align: left;"><img title="CFO" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/CFO.jpg" alt="CFO" border="0" /><strong>If you're a CFO</strong> then maybe you would be interested in a code review<br />
because you're looking for how much it would take to operate the system 5 to 10 years<br />
from now, given different data center dynamics from those your enterprise currently<br />
has.</div>
</div>
<p>The goals really vary depending on who is asking for the code review and what you<br />
want to do with the information you gain from the code review.</p>
<h3>Any common elements across all scenarios?</h3>
<p>In a code review you're looking to measure two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>resiliency, which could be measured in response to:
<ul>
<li>change in the business</li>
<li>change in the technology</li>
<li>change in my staffing model</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the delivery on intent, as represented by:
<ul>
<li>your project plans</li>
<li>your user stories</li>
<li>your white board diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Intent drives development!</h3>
<p>But I always like to say code is truth. Only the source code in the system can really<br />
tell you what happens when the system runs and so you will want to on, a regular basis,<br />
inspect the truth of your system, in asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I really delivering on what I intended to deliver on?</li>
<li>Am I bringing the capabilities into the system that I meant to bring in?*</li>
<li>Did I implement the right thing?</li>
<li>Did I implement it in the way I meant to?**</li>
<li>Am I building in the design for operations that I need within my code base?***</li>
</ul>

<div style="float: left; height: 20px; width: 540px; padding-left: 2px; font-size: 9px;">could<br />
be along the lines of writing secure code, could be along the lines of writing monitoring<br />
code</div>
</div>
<p>In looking for answers, you can inspect lots and lots of other artifacts around the<br />
system, and you can interview people about what they intend to do, but ultimately<br />
only the code in the system can tell you what happens. The goal in gauging delivery<br />
on intent has to be to get in there and look at the real core of the application to<br />
determine if it meets up with what was intended.</p>
<h3>May we evolve?</h3>
<p>The greater goals of the code review should also include determining if the core of<br />
the application is resilient in the face of change.</p>
<h3>Now, to the reasons why code reviews are important...</h3>
<p>It differs depending on who is asking, but in the absence of <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/code-review/" target="_blank">code<br />
review and remediations</a>, in the absence of inspecting a system, regardless of<br />
what characteristics you are inspecting, the system will process along the lines that<br />
individual programmers deem to be wise and the amount of governance that happens to<br />
be in place in your team will largely be the only factor that controls how the system<br />
progresses and how true the system stays to the architectural plan laid in the beginning<br />
of development.</p>

and business alignment.</div>

basis can tell you whether you're actually in line with the vision.</div>
