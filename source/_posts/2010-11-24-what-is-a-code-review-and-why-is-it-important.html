It's very important to reflect on why you're asking for a <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/code-review/" target="_blank">code
review</a>. In the tactical sense, you could say "Oh, I'm looking at individual lines
of code," but rarely is that what is really important. More often than not, it is
business goals that you're measuring against when you have a particular system you
want to evaluate. Often, there is a need for an inspection of a particular system
to see what is "going on" and what the likely challenges are. It's in production now,
it's working, and it's suiting the business, but is there something lurking around
the corner that we don't understand?

<span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">Potentially Relevant Questions:</span>
<ul>
	<li>Is the system healthy?</li>
	<li>Is it going to satisfy performance and scalability needs for the next year, 2 years,
5, 10 years?</li>
	<li>How long is this system likely to live?</li>
	<li>Technology is going to come and go. What are our risks around that?</li>
	<li>In general, what could go wrong?<!--more--></li>
</ul>
An experienced code reviewer, you can call them a system inspector, an auditor, or
a program reviewer, is going to inspect the system in a code review and additionally
an artifact of the code itself, the documentation. (Systems come with varying degrees
of documentation, and of those that have documentation the codifications are in varying
degrees of correctness, some more out of date than others.) Evaluating a system and
doing a code review goes all the way from looking at a system from an architectural
level (the modularity versus the integrated nature of the system) down to perhaps
looking at the way a particular routine was implemented to look for performance and
security characteristics. There is a whole gamut for what one might want to look for
depending on what the business goals are.

<div style="width: 310px; height: 300px; float: left;"><img title="Development Manager" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/developmentmanager.jpg" alt="Development Manager" border="0" /><strong>If you're a development manager</strong> and you have a team of programmers,
perhaps you want to make sure that your programmers are righting secure code and writing
code that is going to perform well or be scalable to a high load with predictable
performance.</div>
<div style="width: 310px; height: 300px; float: right; text-align: left;"><img title="CFO" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/CFO.jpg" alt="CFO" border="0" /><strong>If you're a CFO</strong> then maybe you would be interested in a code review
because you're looking for how much it would take to operate the system 5 to 10 years
from now, given different data center dynamics from those your enterprise currently
has.</div>
</div>
The goals really vary depending on who is asking for the code review and what you
want to do with the information you gain from the code review.
<h3>Any common elements across all scenarios?</h3>
In a code review you're looking to measure two things:
<ol>
	<li>resiliency, which could be measured in response to:
<ul>
	<li>change in the business</li>
	<li>change in the technology</li>
	<li>change in my staffing model</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>the delivery on intent, as represented by:
<ul>
	<li>your project plans</li>
	<li>your user stories</li>
	<li>your white board diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Intent drives development!</h3>
But I always like to say code is truth. Only the source code in the system can really
tell you what happens when the system runs and so you will want to on, a regular basis,
inspect the truth of your system, in asking:
<ul>
	<li>Am I really delivering on what I intended to deliver on?</li>
	<li>Am I bringing the capabilities into the system that I meant to bring in?*</li>
	<li>Did I implement the right thing?</li>
	<li>Did I implement it in the way I meant to?**</li>
	<li>Am I building in the design for operations that I need within my code base?***</li>
</ul>

<div style="float: left; height: 20px; width: 540px; padding-left: 2px; font-size: 9px;">often

<div style="float: left; height: 20px; width: 540px; padding-left: 2px; font-size: 9px;">could
be along the lines of writing secure code, could be along the lines of writing monitoring
code</div>
</div>
In looking for answers, you can inspect lots and lots of other artifacts around the
system, and you can interview people about what they intend to do, but ultimately
only the code in the system can tell you what happens. The goal in gauging delivery
on intent has to be to get in there and look at the real core of the application to
determine if it meets up with what was intended.
<h3>May we evolve?</h3>
The greater goals of the code review should also include determining if the core of
the application is resilient in the face of change.
<h3>Now, to the reasons why code reviews are important...</h3>
It differs depending on who is asking, but in the absence of <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/code-review/" target="_blank">code
review and remediations</a>, in the absence of inspecting a system, regardless of
what characteristics you are inspecting, the system will process along the lines that
individual programmers deem to be wise and the amount of governance that happens to
be in place in your team will largely be the only factor that controls how the system
progresses and how true the system stays to the architectural plan laid in the beginning
of development.

and business alignment.</div>

basis can tell you whether you're actually in line with the vision.</div>
