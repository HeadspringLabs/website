<p>Statistics are king when trying to figure out why something matters, but statistics are God when you need to get an audience of data-driven minds on the same page. I’ve come to this conclusion by being a marketer in a developer’s world.</p>
<p>Often I find myself thinking, “I just know that solution y will solve problem x,” but knowing that will not be enough to convince my fellow developer teammates. Now I am not saying that I’m not swayed by a good statistic, but I can usually be influenced by a trusted teammate's feelings, intuition, or experience. Being a D personality (from the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/improve-corporate-culture-through-the-disc-test" target="_blank">DiSC Personality Profile</a>) a statistic to me is no more than a luxury when trying to make quick decisions.<!--more--></p>
<p>As I prepare to bring my case to the team, feelings, intuition, and experience will not be enough for this group of predominately C’s. So, I start the necessary hunt to provide statistics that will prove ‘solution y’ is truly the answer. Wanting to give my audience of data-driven minds exactly what they want, I quickly become overwhelmed by the amount of data that I can collect and slice up so many ways. And that my friends, is why I am writing this blog!</p>
<p>This blog is a reminder to all my fellow feeling, intuition, and experience folks that find themselves spending days mining data and dividing cell B2 by every other occupied cell in your sheet. Don’t forget (as I recently did) that you just need to find the statistic that most clearly represents why ‘solution y’ is indeed the right solution. I find that I can sometimes avoid this issue by following these steps before collecting a shred of data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down what it is that I am trying to prove.</li>
<li>Write down what data I have access to. And most importantly...</li>
<li>Ask an audience member what's important to them, don’t just assume.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you found ways to not get sucked into the data black hole? Please, share your brilliance with me!</p>
