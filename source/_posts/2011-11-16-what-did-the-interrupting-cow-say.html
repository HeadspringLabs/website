<p>Everyone hates to be interrupted – even people who do it themselves.  It’s rude and can leave a bad impression on any person.  It’s worse than bad breath!  Interrupters are often labeled by their victims as selfish, careless, mean, know-it-alls.   Confronting the problem can be awkward, at best, and can sometimes lead to an even more hostile situation.<!--more--></p>
<p>I have heard this phrase associated with interrupters, “Hate the attitude, not the person.”  However, that’s only half of it. The word attitude has a bad connotation, and it indicates an incorrect assumption about interrupters.  The truth is those who interrupt are well intentioned people.  Often times, all they want to do is help.  It’s not likely that this person is thinking anything about you personally in the moment they are interrupting you.  It’s still rude and impolite, but it’s not necessarily mean.  Therefore it is very important to remember first not to take it personally when you are interrupted.  A little understanding goes a long way.</p>
<p>Think of the other ways in which you experience interruptions, and you may feel more comfortable with managing the nuisance.  Your thoughts are constantly being interrupted by ringing phones and email notifications.  Conversely, sometimes our pesky thoughts can interrupt daily tasks.  Have you ever put a book or an email aside because you had a nagging thought about where you placed your phone? We respect these instinctual interruptions because they have a good purpose.  Verbal interruptions are easier to get upset about, but can also serve a good purpose.</p>
<p>People who verbally interrupt are everywhere, and we all have to work with them.  In fact, it can be a good thing.  Many successful business people are hailed for their quick-thinking skills. Their processes are not linear, and that is an indicative characteristic of creativity.  An interrupter has the ability to think and express themself differently, which should be recognized as a benefit when those features are utilized in the appropriate environment.  Instead of ignoring or resisting these people’s thoughts or ideas, try using them.  If a chronic interrupter breaks the pattern of a brainstorming exercise, try thanking them.  Say something like “Thank you. Would you mind holding on to or writing down your thought, so we can discuss it?” By keeping things positive, you will have the opportunity to cultivate the interrupters thought and get the conversation back on track without creating tension.</p>
<p>What are some other ways that your office copes with interruption?</p>
