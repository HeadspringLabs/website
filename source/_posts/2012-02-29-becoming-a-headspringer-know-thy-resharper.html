<p>Since I'm new to Headspring and we are hiring, I thought I would help give an edge to anyone applying and subscribing to our blog. There are many “features” (pun attempted) that make up a Headspringer and I’m hoping my fellow Headspring bloggers will help me verbalize them through the “Becoming a Headspringer” blog series. I will be starting this series with some quick tips on <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>. If you do not already have ReSharper or know what it is, immediately after reading this post is as good a time as any to try it out.</p>
<p>I was assigned my first development project a few weeks ago and was quickly told my hand reached for the mouse too often by Mr. Justin Pope. If you know me at all, you know that I enjoy shortcuts and dislike the mouse quite a bit. In fact, at my previous job, I removed all of my team members’ mice so they would be forced to learn to navigate with the keyboard for a day. So when  I was told I use the mouse too much, I knew I was going to love it at Headspring and thoroughly enjoy becoming a Headspringer. Shortly after a friendly insult, Mr. Justin Pope gave me a quick crash course in many of the common ReSharper shortcuts and I will share some of those shortcuts with you.</p>
<h2>Navigate to a File</h2>
<p>ctrl+n (to navigate to specific type) or ctrl+shift+n (to navigate to a specific file or folder)</p>
<h2>Highlight within File</h2>
<p>ctrl+w (continue pressing w until everything you want highlighted is highlighted)</p>
<h2>Safe Delete</h2>
<p>alt+del (tells you whether or not it’s safe to delete a method, property, class, etc)</p>
<h2>Go to Usages</h2>
<p>ctrl+alt+f7 (shows all usages of a particular method, property, class, etc)</p>
<h2>Parameter information</h2>
<p>ctrl+p (must be just inside parentheses)</p>
<h2>Create Constructor</h2>
<p>1. alt+insert (not just to insert constructor)</p>
<p>2. Select “Constructor” (if you already have fields defined, it will prompt if you want to initialize them)</p>
<h2>Introduce Variable</h2>
<p>1. Highlight what needs to become a variable</p>
<p>2. ctrl+alt+v</p>
<h2>Move Variable to Outer Scope</h2>
<p>1. Navigate near the variable name</p>
<p>2. alt+enter</p>
<p>3. Select “Move to outer scope”</p>
<h2>Create a New Class or File Based on Another</h2>
<p>1. ctrl+n (to navigate to a similar class) or ctrl+shift+n (to navigate to a similar file)</p>
<p>2. alt+shift+l (to navigate to the file in the Solution Explorer)</p>
<p>3. ctrl+c (to copy)</p>
<p>4. ctrl+v (to paste)</p>
<p>5. F2 (to rename)</p>
<p>6. Enter (to open)</p>
<p>7. Start modifying the file</p>
<p align="left">The shortcuts above are a small percentage of the shortcuts I found useful, but a good start to becoming a more productive developer. You may also notice that not all of these are specifically ReSharper shortcuts, some of them are Visual Studio or Windows shortcuts. Anyhow, you can <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Reference__Keyboard_Shortcuts.html">find a more extensive list of ReSharper shortcuts on the Jetbrains site</a>.</p>
<p align="left">As I mentioned above, Headspring is hiring. So if you are interested in being challenged, working with smart people, and being led by a great group of people, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/about-us/careers">apply</a>!</p>
