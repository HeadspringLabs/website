<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/get-to-know-a-developer-mahendra-mavani/img_5988" rel="attachment wp-att-2925"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2925" title="IMG_5988" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_5988-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>This week, I took the opportunity to sit down and chat with one of our Principal Consultants, Mahendra Mavani.  Mahendra is the project lead on our most recognized work with the CUC, creating the Juvenile Case Management System (JCMS).  Out of that project came two homegrown, open source creations: Automapper and CommandProcessor.  Here is how our talk went:<!--more--></p>
<p>What tools and technologies would you consider yourself an expert in?</p>
<ul>
<li>I can say I am an expert in building stand alone, web apps, web services and enterprise integration using nServiceBus, ASP.NET, MVC, nHibernate, and StructureMap. My preferred methodologies include Agile, Scrum/XP, and Lean.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What work or studies have you done with these tools and technologies?</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been using all these tools and technology on various consulting projects in South Africa, Singapore, and Netherlands since 2002. Throughout that time, I have contributed to open source projects like Automapper, NAAK, MvcContrib, and <a href="http://autopilot-dotnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/">AutoPilot-dotnet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What tools and technology are you really interested in?</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m not married to any tools or technology.  I strongly believe in solving business problems with tools/technology that result in the simplest possible solution with the least amount of technical debt.  Today’s tools are going to be outdated tomorrow but underlying principles will remain unchanged.  For example, S.O.L.I.D. Principle or Agile – there are new variations but the principle concepts remain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is your strongest character trait?</p>
<ul>
<li>I allow myself to make mistakes as I strongly believe “If you don’t make any mistakes, then you aren’t trying hard enough.” I wish that our education system worked this way.  My attitude towards learning new things and experimenting with the unknown has never let me down.  What others see as a challenge, I see as an opportunity to advance.</li>
</ul>
