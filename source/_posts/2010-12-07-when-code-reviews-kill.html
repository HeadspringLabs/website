<p>How do you communicate what you've found in a <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/code-review/" target="_blank">code<br />
review</a> when you do not have a long established relationship with the owners of<br />
the system? The most important thing you have to do is establish a framework up front<br />
of what the expectations of the code review are. As mentioned in our prior posting<br />
(<a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/2010/11/24/WhatIsACodeReviewAndWhyIsItImportant.aspx" target="_blank">"What<br />
is a code review and why is it important?"</a>) the questions you're going be trying<br />
to answer and the areas of the system you're really interested in evaluating are going<br />
to vary depending on both who is asking the questions and why they are interested.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're going to need to know the kind of information you are looking for and how it<br />
manifests at a team level to determine if developers are working with best practices.</li>
<li>You will need to review code in the small, immediate scope up to a more strategic<br />
evaluation of a whole asset, possibly for acquisition, to answer the question: Does<br />
this software asset have a viable lifetime to it in the future?</li>
<li>Where your evaluations are going to strongly focus on architecture, you will need<br />
to know what standards you're aiming for so that you can deliver objective information<br />
that's valuable at the right level of clarity.<!--more--></li>
</ul>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>Personal relationships are very important, especially in this type of offering, and<br />
when inspecting someone's software system, where we're going to find things that are<br />
quite good and we are going to find things which need improvement. If a code review<br />
finds no room for improvement, then the assessors were simply not looking hard enough.<br />
A cornerstone of success is building a relationship and that starts with <span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">listening:</span></p>
<p><img style="margin: 4px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;" title="listening" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/listening.jpg" alt="listening" border="0" /></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to perform any assessment about a software system, we have to understand<br />
what it does. We have to understand the business model it serves and what part of<br />
the business it enables. This requires a lot of listening.</li>
<li>It also requires recognition that the software system has undergone tremendous change<br />
within a successful business and that it has reacted to a changing business environment.<br />
Without an understanding of what business and architectural decisions have been made,<br />
we cannot form an accurate or complete understanding of the system in question.</li>
<li>Only after listening and proving our understanding of the system in question can we<br />
expect to have relational credit with, and trust from, the client we're serving. Our<br />
ability to make and communicate an assessment about any software system depends on<br />
listening.</li>
</ul>

<h2>I'd like to tell you something. You'd better have a seat.</h2>
<p>Now the next part is communicating what we found in the code review. That needs to<br />
stand on the shoulders of a solid relationship with the owners of the system.</p>
<p>To start with it's important to communicate the high level findings as it relates<br />
to the goals of the client. For instance if it is performance or if it is scaling<br />
or if it is load characteristics that are undesirable, we need to relate the findings<br />
back to how it is going to allow the business to either serve more customers, serve<br />
them faster, process more data, or be less costly to operate. If the review is a risk<br />
and health assessment, we need to communicate the types of risks that we often see<br />
and give a very good broad overview of what those are.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; float: right;" title="an informational body of evidence and some prescriptive guidance" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/bodyofevidence.jpg" alt="an informational body of evidence and some prescriptive guidance" border="0" /></p>
<p>The code review is going to produce two kinds of artifacts:</p>
<ol>
<li>an informational body of evidence</li>
<li>some prescriptive guidance</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the stakeholders and other parties involved are going to want to really be<br />
able to see for themselves all the documentation and possibly draw some of their own<br />
conclusions from it, but, beyond raw reports, we want to make sure we are able to<br />
communicate some prescriptive guidance in the service of a specific set of questions<br />
which have guided our analysis and which the clients have posed about their software<br />
assets. And yet, we want to make sure that we're providing not only those end recommendations<br />
but also the body of evidence, objectively acquired, that is causing us to bring those<br />
conclusions.</p>
<p>No code review is complete without offering recommendations. No one just asks for<br />
a code review. The questions behind the questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given what we have, where are we going?</li>
<li>What can you do to help us get there?<br />
<img title="questions" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/questions.jpg" alt="questions" border="0" /></li>
</ol>
<h2>We're paid for recommendations, not criticism.</h2>
<p>The recommendations really comprise the value that is behind a code review. Obviously,<br />
if there is a target problem in the data center like the system slowing down or not<br />
being able to serve all the users, then it's very concrete and obvious as to how we<br />
may improve the performance of the system. But, if the question is "How do we insure<br />
that our investment in this system is going to last 10 or 20 years and not expire<br />
in 4 or 5 years?," then it's really important that the recommendations are scoped<br />
accordingly. We've offered recommendations from performance and security improvements<br />
all the way to how to migrate from one version of a system to another and how to ensure<br />
that the structure of the system can last not only 20 years but can support indefinite<br />
upgrades without the risk of becoming stale, difficult to work with, and requiring<br />
a complete replacement.</p>
<p>Way too often we find systems designed with no thought to the future, and at some<br />
point they have to be completely rewritten, with the previous investment nearly invalidated<br />
because of some shortsighted business and architectural decisions. It may not be pleasant<br />
for a client to hear they are trending towards such a fate, but a client ultimately<br />
wants to know how to correct course.</p>
