Since you're already reading this blog, you are probably most familiar with his weekly blog <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/plioi">series</a> for Headspring.  He holds the title in our office for top technical blog author.  Patrick has a strong attention to detail, and this character trait is quite evident in his writing.  But blogging is just what Patrick does in his spare time.  Along with writing, he is also a dedicated developer</p>
<p>He picked up programming with Pascal as a teenager, and never looked back.  “I knew right away that I wanted to write software for a living,” he says.  Patrick is most interested in programming languages and compilers. In fact, he is an all-out expert with C#, focusing on the lesser-known corners of the language.  He has used C# on a wide variety of projects since its initial release, including an open-source text parsing library named <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley">Parsley</a>. He's also using Parsley to experiment with a language of his own, <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook">Rook</a>, which should be ready for public consumption, “Sometime around the heat-death of the universe.”<!--more--></p>
<p>The most delightful thing about Patrick is his genuine nature.  He simply enjoys what he does. He told me, “I get a kick out of learning the differences between programming languages, so I tend to learn more about the nitty-gritty details of the languages I use the most.” He then went on to explain that the styles and opinions promoted by other languages also inform his decisions when writing in C#.</p>
<p>When he is not writing code or blogs, Patrick likes to revisit his favorite book, <em>Anathem</em> by Neal Stephenson:</p>

<p>Patrick joined the Headspring team in April of this year, and we are so happy to have him.  To learn more, visit his <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/plioi">blogs</a>, or tweet @plioi.</p>
