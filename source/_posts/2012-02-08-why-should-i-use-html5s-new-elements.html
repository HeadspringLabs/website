A question I’m frequently asked typically goes something like this:

<blockquote>
  "I hear about all these new HTML tags, but I don’t have any problem with using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s like I've always done. Why should I care?"
</blockquote>

The questioners are referring to the new elements introduced with HTML5, including <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> (which encapsulates a part of your page containing navigation elements), <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> (think of a newspaper story, with its heading, byline, callouts, etc.), and <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/new-structural-elements-in-html5/">among others</a>. While it's true the Web survived for many years without these new elements, there's no reason to stand on tradition. The new elements provide a number of benefits to both Web developers and end users, and, best of all, you can start using them right away!

<li><strong>Content aggregators and search providers can better figure out your content.</strong> News aggregators and search engines are everywhere, and are often an excellent way to disseminate your published content. Why not make it easy on them by explicitly marking what parts of your page they care about and what parts they can ignore?</li>
<li><strong>Screen readers need all the help they can get.</strong> Many potential visitors require assistive devices to view the Web, but Web sites have been slow to adopt tools to help. HTML5’s new elements help out by letting screen readers know what sections of the page represent real content, and what sections are simply visual fluff.</li>
<li><strong>The new tags are there, regardless.</strong> Either natively or with easy and clever workarounds, practically all browsers in use today recognize the new elements. Plus, they've been standardized by a number of industry groups. It's never been easier to simply start working with them and you can rest easy knowing the new elements are here to stay.</li>
<li><strong>Your coworkers will thank you.</strong> The new elements are far more descriptive than the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> standby is, meaning the same content is considerably more understandable to other developers looking at your HTML source. Self-explanatory semantic markup reduces confusion and is often cleaner-looking than its cousins with pervasive use of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags.</li>
<li><strong>You're probably already using them.</strong> These elements were added to the HTML5 specification because Web designers were already using them...just in a more verbose format. Most Web sites have common sections, like a header, navigation, and footer, yet there was no way to signify this with HTML. Thanks to the new elements, instead of something like this (which used to be all over the Internet):

<pre><code>&lt;div id='footer'&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

...we now have a much more concise representation of the same concept:

<pre><code>&lt;footer&gt;...&lt;/footer&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Much better.</p></li>
</ul>

Whether you're working on a Web site for the newest, hottest start-up or helping maintain a 10-year-old internal Web site, the new HTML5 elements can provide you with a number of benefits. They're easy to start using, respected by Web developers and search engines alike, and, soon, you’ll start to wonder how you lived without them.

Have you encountered other benefits of using the new HTML5 elements? Have a particularly-elegant use case for one? Let us know in the comments!
