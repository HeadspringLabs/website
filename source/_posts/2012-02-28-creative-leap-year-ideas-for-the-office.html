<p>Because it’s a leap year, we get to take advantage of an extra day of work.  What are you going to do with all the extra time?! Here is a list of great ideas to make February 29th 2012 a day to remember:<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>1.  Throw a party for your employees, or clients, or both</strong></p>
<p>Let the extra day stand out by throwing a leap year party at your office.  It doesn’t have to be wild; just a little happy hour will do fine.  Invite clients to join in, or keep it just for employees as a special “thank you” for their extra day of work.  Incorporate the party theme with fun ideas, like only playing music that was popular in a previous leap year, or giving prizes for people who create nostalgic costumes from popular fashion in other leap years, and playing games with quarters.</p>
<p><strong>2. Offer something for free</strong></p>
<p>Some companies are creating 25% off door buster promotions for leap year, but nothing beats free.  Host a seminar or a webinar on this extra day, or offer free books and whitepapers.  If you’re business is consulting, consider opening up half the day to help area non-profits and charities with free business advice.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Host an office contest</strong></p>
<p>Office contests are a great way to keep things interesting on an otherwise mundane day at work.  Hold an all day scavenger hunt or a contest that uses the number “4”, like four lines of poetry in four minutes and four-legged races.  If you can’t think of anything fun, split your staff up into teams of four and have them come up with cool contest ideas. Also, consider giving a special bonus or incentive for sales deals that are closed on February 29th.</p>
<p><strong>4. If you’re brave, give your employees the day off</strong></p>
<p>It may seem like a bold move, but what could you lose? Give them the option to take a half day or work from home – especially if the weather is nice.  Show the staff that the extra day is for their families and not work.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get involved with <a href="http://leapyearproject.org/">The Leapyear Project</a></strong></p>
<p>This is a simple startup that is encouraging people to take risks that could change the world this year.  Your business can choose a charitable project, promote it through this movement, and throw a party to celebrate the announcement.  You can also choose to become a corporate sponsor or partner, and assist other leap year projects through time/talent/donations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you do, big or small, don’t let the extra day go unnoticed.  Tell us how your company is using the extra day.</p>
