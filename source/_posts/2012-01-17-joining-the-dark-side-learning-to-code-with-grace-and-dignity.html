Upon the suggestion of a coworker I joined 342,787 people (and counting) with a 2012 resolution to learn how to code.  It’s called <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear</a>, presented by <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0">CodeAcademy</a>, supported by companies like YCombinator, and made viral by the addition of my fellow student, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/05/bloomberg-codecademy/">Michael Bloomberg</a>.   It’s a very simple, learn as you go platform, with big clean buttons and “dumbed down” explanations for the average Joe (or Jill).  I get an email every Monday with a new lesson to work on for the week.  As I progress, I earn badges and bragging rights to publish on Facebook and Twitter.

There are a number of courses and levels to choose from, and I have just completed the first one, “Getting Started with Programming”.  After creating an account, I can sign in and access courses that I am working on and track my progress.<!--more-->

Here are a couple screen shots which demonstrate the clean design and learning module:

Now, let me take the time to clearly state that <strong>I have absolutely no intention of becoming a programmer</strong>. If I wanted to be a programmer, there are plenty of resources out there for entering a career in programming, all of which existed long before CodeAcademy came along.  What attracts me to this particular platform is that it is built specifically for non-technical people to learn how to think like a technical person when needed.

I can already tell this is going to be a very beneficial process for me.

I am surrounded by developers at work and at home, and I have found that they are a unique breed of communicators.  You see, in marketing, we care about the ideas, elaborating on them, and we don’t care much for the process of getting from A to B.

<strong>Conversely, developers (good ones) care about the process just as much as they care about the conclusion</strong>.  Words, steps, and systems are really important to them.  They think the way code looks!  If a statement at the top of a string of code does not compute correctly, then the statement at the bottom of the string of code cannot compute either, <em>even if</em> that second statement is true.  Let me demonstrate with a snippet from Lesson 8 of “Getting Started with Programming”:
<p style="text-align: center;">The while loop defined in the editor code won't ever run because its condition, times <code>&gt;</code> 0 <code>&amp;&amp;</code>times <code>&lt;</code> 3, is never true since times <code>=</code> 0 and the two conditions 0 <code>&gt;</code> 0 <code>&amp;&amp;</code> 0 <code>&lt;</code> 3 evaluates tofalse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If the conditions of the loop aren't met, the code will be skipped entirely.</p>
Does this read like a familiar scenario? Now that I have been exposed to the process of coding, I am starting to notice the similarities between speaking to a developer and reading what a developer creates.

And the benefits don’t stop with enhanced communication.  I’m looking forward to being a more versatile teammate, not having to ask so many questions, and the possibility of using code to make my daily tasks easier.

But don’t take my word for it.  There are plenty of helpful blogs out there that detail the benefits of learning to code, like this one: <a href="http://www.giftrocket.com/why-marketing-bd-should-learn-to-code">10 Reasons Why Marketing and BD Professionals Should Learn to Code</a>.

So if you have ever considered learning how to code, I encourage you to visit <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear.com</a>, or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23codeyear">#codeyear</a> trending topic on Twitter (follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/headspring">@headspring</a> while you're there).
