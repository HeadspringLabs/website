The end of the year is traditionally an optimal time for strategic planning.  Although, planning can often feel like the most daunting task to be sandwiched between holiday vacations and family feasts.  There are so many excuses for putting it aside and focusing on tasks with more immediate impact.  Furthermore, there is no plan yet to execute, so writing one involves sharpening knives and awakening your Mojo.  Good ideas have a funny way of hiding themselves behind a blank page.  When faced with this internal attitude, first remember the golden rule of planning:  you are not guaranteed success with a plan, but without one, you are sure to fail.  It's best to get started sooner than later. Once you have brainstormed ideas, strategic planning is just a matter of outlining your format and explaining your thoughts.<!--more-->

With that said, I have put together a "Do's and Don'ts" survival kit for writer's block:

<strong>DO</strong> Get some fresh air.  It's no surprise the physical activity recharges the brain, so take a walk around your block or building.  It only takes five minutes, and is likely to revive your sanity.  Alternatively, take your laptop outside with you and work in the elements.  You'll be away from office chatter, interruptions, and the same stagnant setting that got you down in the first place.

<strong>DON'T</strong> Go to a coffee shop with your laptop.  Coffee shops are typically cited as great work spaces because they offer unlimited caffeine, WIFI, and a community fostering environment.  However, isolation is important when writing a plan.  Planning requires you to focus on harnessing your thoughts, and becoming overly distracted may be harmful to the critical transition from idea to strategy.  Instead, visit a coffee shop when you are brainstorming.  Bring a paper and pen, and jot down notes of whatever comes to you.  Maybe you'll hear a conversation or observe some group behavior that will give you a good idea.

<strong>DO </strong>Implement a writing schedule.  Allocate your time so that you can prevent total exhaustion. There should be specific times in your day, maybe two hours, designated solely for writing your plan.  When the time is up, put your pen down and move on to the next task.  It may be helpful to have the subsequent task already specified, so as to alleviate the transition.

<strong>DON'T </strong> Be to hard on yourself.  Remember that you are only preparing the first draft; you're not married to it.  Even if you finish thinking it's perfect, rest assured, someone is going to want to make some changes.  So don't take it too personally.  It is much easier to rework the plan once you have it written out.

Strategic planning is important, but you can't hang a blank canvas.  The first step is choosing to do it.  How is your company preparing for the new year?
