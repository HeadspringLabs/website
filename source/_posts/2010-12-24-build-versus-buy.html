<p>When do you make the assessment of build versus buy with a client? It all comes down<br />
to the core competency of the business at hand.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">An Example:</span> There<br />
are programmers within a software company that sells a software product, so the company<br />
in question may have the skills necessary to do all kinds of types of programming.<br />
In fact, the product is an off-the-shelf software package, and the company has made<br />
quite a bit of money with it. A consensus builds of "OK, we need to revamp our website,<br />
and put some interactive features within our website." Then a "solution" follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Obviously, we have programmers internally."</li>
<li>"We possess the skills."</li>
<li>"I'm just gonna go task some of my programmers with building our own website."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Now...</h2>
<p>The company makes money in selling a software product. The company does not make money<br />
selling its website. The website is part of marketing and lead generation, and things<br />
like that. And so, the build versus buy decision would entail:</p>
<ul>
<li>estimating how much you would spend internally on the website versus how much you<br />
would have to invest if you were to both get a bid from a vendor and have that particular<br />
vendor charge you some money in exchange for developing the website</li>
<li>a return on investment analysis with the internal cost juxtaposed against the outsourced<br />
cost<!--more--></li>
</ul>
<p><img title="immediate costs and opportunity costs" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/costs.jpg" alt="immediate costs and opportunity costs" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">Conflicted? Look at the<br />
bottom line.</span></p>
<p>Most of the time, hiring a company that specializes in website development is probably<br />
going to be cheaper than multitasking some product software developers into doing<br />
a website.</p>
<ul>
<li>The salary alone for the time spent on the task is probably going to be more expensive<br />
for competent individuals generally versed in software (but not specifically practiced<br />
at web development) than for a vendor who does this day in and day out and can crank<br />
out the website in a few weeks and charge you a few thousand dollars.</li>
<li>Beyond immediate costs lie opportunity costs. Your developers are not focusing on<br />
the product that you're selling if they are building your web site!</li>
<li>There are a lot of factors that go into the build versus buy decision, but it all<br />
comes down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you make money at?</li>
<li>keeping your resources and your staff focused on that</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/2010/10/18/FocusOnYourCoreCompetencyOutsourceEverythingElse.aspx">outsourcing<br />
things that otherwise distract your most important people</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
