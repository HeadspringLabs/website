When do you make the assessment of build versus buy with a client? It all comes down
to the core competency of the business at hand.

<span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">An Example:</span> There
are programmers within a software company that sells a software product, so the company
in question may have the skills necessary to do all kinds of types of programming.
In fact, the product is an off-the-shelf software package, and the company has made
quite a bit of money with it. A consensus builds of "OK, we need to revamp our website,
and put some interactive features within our website." Then a "solution" follows:
<ul>
	<li>"Obviously, we have programmers internally."</li>
	<li>"We possess the skills."</li>
	<li>"I'm just gonna go task some of my programmers with building our own website."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Now...</h2>
The company makes money in selling a software product. The company does not make money
selling its website. The website is part of marketing and lead generation, and things
like that. And so, the build versus buy decision would entail:
<ul>
	<li>estimating how much you would spend internally on the website versus how much you
would have to invest if you were to both get a bid from a vendor and have that particular
vendor charge you some money in exchange for developing the website</li>
	<li>a return on investment analysis with the internal cost juxtaposed against the outsourced
cost<!--more--></li>
</ul>

<span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">Conflicted? Look at the
bottom line.</span>

Most of the time, hiring a company that specializes in website development is probably
going to be cheaper than multitasking some product software developers into doing
a website.
<ul>
	<li>The salary alone for the time spent on the task is probably going to be more expensive
for competent individuals generally versed in software (but not specifically practiced
at web development) than for a vendor who does this day in and day out and can crank
out the website in a few weeks and charge you a few thousand dollars.</li>
	<li>Beyond immediate costs lie opportunity costs. Your developers are not focusing on
the product that you're selling if they are building your web site!</li>
	<li>There are a lot of factors that go into the build versus buy decision, but it all
comes down to:
<ul>
	<li>What do you make money at?</li>
	<li>keeping your resources and your staff focused on that</li>

things that otherwise distract your most important people</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
