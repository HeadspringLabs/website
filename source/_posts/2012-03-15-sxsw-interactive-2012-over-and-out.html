<p>Last Friday I took to the Austin Convention Center for the five day frenzy known as SXSW Interactive.  Basically, I made this meme summing up my time spent downtown quite nicely:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/sxsw-interactive-2012-over-and-out/sxswwhatiactuallydo" rel="attachment wp-att-4127"><img class="size-large wp-image-4127 aligncenter" title="sxswWhatIActuallyDo" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/sxswWhatIActuallyDo-1024x651.png" alt="" width="517" height="329" /><!--more--></a></p>
<p>The lines were insane! I waited three hours to pick up my badge.  However, the rest of the time I experienced very little trouble getting into the panels I wanted to see or any of the other events on my schedule.  I would have been lost without the iPhone and iPad app.</p>
<p>During the event, I exercised the full use of all available resources:  time, research, relationships, and drink tickets.  I kept a full schedule each day, beginning at 9:00 AM and lasting into the late evening.  During the day, I made it to as many presentations, panels, and discussions as possible - usually 3 to 4.  The first few days there, I was being carried by adrenaline, and made the mistake of neglecting breaks.  Next year will be different.</p>
<p>My favorite panels and presentations were those that were well thought out and prepared.  I really liked Ray Kurzweil’s discussion about AI and singularity, Jen Pahlka’s presentation on Code for America, and the panel on Agile Apps: Effective Moblie and Native Development.  Here are some more photos:</p>

<p>In between scheduled events, I would browse the trade show floor, designated networking lounges and workshops. I reserved some time each day to check in with fellow industry friends, and exchange information on who’s who and where the free food was.</p>
<p>The panels and discussions exceeded my expectations.  The content was current, interesting, and informative, and the presentations - led by credible industry influencers – were well prepared and polished.  Topics ranged from highly technical, to quirky and imaginative, or challenging and perceptive.  I took lots of notes.</p>
<p>With over 30,000 attendees, there was no shortage of opportunity to network.  I made it a point to get to know the people around me at events, sitting next to me during presentations, or evening those that I stood in line with.  Because SXSW is designed to encourage community and relationship building, I found that most people were very open to participating in conversation when prompted. The parties each evening were great for meeting up, too, although we tried to keep the business chatter light.</p>
<p>However the <em>best</em> part of the conference was supporting the<a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/headspring-shows-some-love-at-knowbilitys-austin-air"> Headspring Hurwitzes</a> as they received 2<sup>nd</sup> Place in the Formula One division of Knowbility’s AIR Interactive Competition.  I’m so proud of my team!  Here is a picture of them with their award:</p>

<p>So, now that it’s over I’ll be catching up on my beauty rest and rehydrating.  I’m looking forward to next year!</p>
