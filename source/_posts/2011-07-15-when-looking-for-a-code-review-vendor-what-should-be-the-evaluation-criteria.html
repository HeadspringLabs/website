This is never just a business effort. This is never just a coaching effort. This is a process of bringing all of these elements to bear in order to make targeted assessments and recommendations to achieve specific goals.

The ideal vendor should have a demonstrated history of being able to guide their customers through the improvement process and be someone who not only finds issues but who can also make recommendations and then can also take those recommendations and actually help you act on them to really achieve the goal you set out for in the first place.<!--more-->

You also have to look at the alignment that the vendor has to your way of doing business. Obviously, you would select a different vendor if you have a market cap of several billion dollars versus having a small company where you must make payroll for twenty folks.

Also the type of software matters because it takes a different type of person to assess a system that perhaps runs a high traffic ecommerce website with a backend order management system than it does an internal system for a local livestock show and rodeo. The two have very different characteristics, and few companies have as broad a range of consultants as is needed to be able to serve every end of the spectrum and all the different points in between. At Headspring, we certainly are not a good fit for everyone, and we certainly don't have the capability to evaluate every system that exists out in the wild.

<strong>The Screening Criteria</strong>
But when looking for a vendor, keep that in mind. Be able to describe the type of environment you are in, and, for some, ask for a description of their previous engagements and try to find out what similarities you have with their previous clients. Really drill down to see if there is a fit, because not every vendor will be a fit.

For us, not every client is a fit. We recognize that, and we value our evaluation of clients just as much as we encourage the client's evaluation of us.

After determining that there is a great fit, the likelihood of success is really great.

We would love to share with you some of the success stories we have had in code review. Perhaps we are a good match for each other. Contact Headspring today to see if we fit your need.
