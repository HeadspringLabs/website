<p>Cedric has been in Austin for a few years, and just welcomed his first born son into the family 5 weeks ago!  We talked about Austin, why working here is so much fun, and what we really love about technology.  As it turns out we share a lot of the same interests in bringing together communities through technology.  His experiences are going to be a real help to me with planning and preparation for Headspring’s Central Texas <a href="http://ctxgivecamp.org/">Give Camp</a> in September.</p>
<p>Here’s how the rest of our conversation went:</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I’m really great at creating tangible systems for internal processes.  This can be really useful to organizations when it comes time to, say, track metrics.  At my last job, I developed an authentication system for web applications, and integrated some ERP systems for order automation.  I think I’m good at this because I tend to approach problem solving visually, with a creative mindset, before getting analytical.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>Coming to Headspring to work with Jimmy and Jeffrey is definitely up there on my list.  I would also really like to work on a project with Apple one day.  I really appreciate their design methodology</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>When I was in 5<sup>th</sup> grade my teacher had a puzzle closet.  If we solved the puzzles, we would get free days and homework excuses.  I got really good at solving the puzzles and I pretty much never had to do homework.  I think that was the early start of my interest in engineering, and software development stemmed from it as a natural extension of problem solving.  By high school, I found myself using or creating software all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Teaching is the best way to study.  It requires me to understand all the levels of details that go into something.  In my opinion, you don’t fully cement an idea until you teach it.</p>
<p><strong>Where do begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I study Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and one of the concepts I’ve realized is that you have to be able to throw yourself into a challenge.  When thrown into a challenge, we immediately begin to imitate the opponent.  After that, we go through a series of experiments until skills become instinctual.  Anything I’m learning I can approach the same way.  Imitate first, experiment and learn.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>If I learn or gain mastery, it’s definitely time well spent.  Sometimes that’s not always so easy to see, especially if my results don’t match my expectations.  But if I can learn through my mistakes, then it’s worth it to me.</p>
