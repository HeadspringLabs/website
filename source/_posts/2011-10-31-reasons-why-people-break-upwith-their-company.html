The latest YouTube sensation got us thinking about why people quit their jobs. Joey DeFrancesco got help from his marching band to quit his job at a hotel, after 3.5 years of working there, because he said he was treated poorly by management. Joey surprised his manager by announcing his resignation followed by an instrumental celebration, which was filmed and posted on YouTube. His video has received almost 3 million views in 2 weeks. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A4UGtM4hDQ&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;noredirec">View Joey’s instrumental resignation</a>.<!--more-->

Similar to relationships, people and their jobs don’t always work out. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported more employees left their jobs voluntarily than were laid off in 2010. Here are some reasons reported why people quit their jobs or are seriously considering resigning.
<ul>
	<li><strong>They couldn’t stand their boss</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Job Stress</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The company was struggling</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Better opportunities</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Being stretched to the limit</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Boredom</strong></li>
</ul>
Below are a few tips that we follow that have led to a positive impact for our employee retention efforts:

Studies have shown people thrive in positions where they feel they are contributing and making a difference. Employees like to be part of the big picture plan to help the company succeed, so let them know what the big picture plan is and how their role will directly impact the company getting there.

Employees also like to know they have a career path laid out for them at your company. Make it clear about what it takes to progress in your company. Career progression also includes salary and benefits, which will help keep employees engaged and happy.

Get regular feedback from your employees. Ask how you’re performing or, if appropriate, send an anonymous survey to understand what your employees think about their jobs, the company, your performance, etc. Often people don’t leave the companies, they leave poor managers. Have regular formal or informal catch-ups with your employees to gauge where they are.

Are there things or tips you’ve seen or are doing in your company to help employee retention?
