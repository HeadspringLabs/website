<p>Last weekend, Headspring hosted a charity hackathon benefiting eight Central Texas nonprofits. Forty-nine GiveCamp volunteers, many of them Headspring employees, gathered at Headspring’s corporate office for a three-day marathon of pro-bono website design and development. <!--more--></p>
<p>Headspring jumped at the chance to host the first Central Texas edition of this national initiative.  The Headspring team is community-focused and participates annually in the Accessibility Internet Rally (held in March in conjunction with SXSW).  When we heard about the technology needs of local nonprofit organizations, we knew this would be another fun way to give back to the community and was right up our alley.</p>
<p>The eight local nonprofit organizations included Arlington Urban Ministries, A.S.P.I.R.E. (Awarding Students and Promoting Increased Rigor in Education), Austin Partners in Education, Bluebonnet RCD, Texas Hill Country RCD, Texas Kidney Foundation, TexVet, and Big Dogs, Huge Paws. Our development teams met each nonprofits’ specific needs, including redesigning websites, automating donation processes, creating donor databases, and more.</p>
<p>In the end, 1,029 hours of time and $75,000 worth of in-kind services were donated.<br />
