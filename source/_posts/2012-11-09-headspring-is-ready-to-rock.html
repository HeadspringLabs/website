<p>What event sells out as fast as a Justin Beiber concert? <a href="http://codemash.org/" target="_blank">CodeMash</a>! Last year’s CodeMash conference sold out in 22 minutes. Bieber actually sold his entire North American tour in that time, but why mince words?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>We are excited to get together with developers from across the country for <a href="http://codemash.org/" target="_blank">CodeMash 2013</a> being held January 8 – 11, 2013 in Sandusky, Ohio. The conference is filled with information about updated practices, methodologies, and technology trends in a variety of platforms and development languages. There are terrific keynote speakers, workshops, time to geek out with fellow attendees and talk “code”, and possibly take a dip in Ohio’s largest indoor waterpark.</p>
<p>Our team members Jimmy Bogard and Sharon Cichelli will be leading sessions at CodeMash.  Sharon will present “Hello, Arduino: Write Code that Interacts with the Real World” and Jimmy will be involved in the PreCompiler workshop.</p>

<p>Jimmy is also on his own world tour. He is speaking at various international locations over the next three months beginning on December 4, 2012 in London, England where he’ll talk about “Real World Polyglot Persistence”.  Check out other scheduled events below:</p>
