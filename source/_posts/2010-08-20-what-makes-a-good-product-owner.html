<p>What I've found is that the terms "product owner" and "subject matter expert" often<br />
get confused with one another. A product owner ultimately should be responsible for<br />
numerous things that a subject matter expert will not be qualified to handle such<br />
as prioritization, constructing a vision for the product, and a timeline for which<br />
to release the different modules of that eventual product. I see a product owner as<br />
being the single source of requirements for a system which interacts with subject<br />
matter experts and key stakeholders to produce the plan for building a product and<br />
releasing it in phases. A product owner needs to be capable of interacting effectively<br />
with business stakeholders, subject matter experts, and also a development construction<br />
team.</p>

<p>The product owner role of prioritization, fielding estimates and modifying prior priorities<br />
based on estimates is very critical and requires a very specific skill in order to<br />
be done well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many organizations don't have a need to keep that skill on their staff. It's just<br />
not appropriate for a large number of businesses.</li>
<li>But, an organization, more likely, may need to buy a business application or a records<br />
management system to assist the business or to help manage information and the sharing<br />
of it.</li>
<li>At <a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>, we are most<br />
successful in projects where we provide the product owner role, which then reports<br />
to the client organization that brought us on to do the project.</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="float: left; padding: 3px 10px 3px 0px;" title="Product Owner" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/productowner.jpg" alt="Product Owner" />The<br />
skill to understand the organization's needs and craft a solution, as well as to determine<br />
what to trade off of the expenses for a return on investment, and to determine what<br />
to do when, who to serve first, and what to defer, is critical to ensuring the success<br />
of a project. This skill overlaps quite a bit with the skill that a software architect<br />
will have, but for a product owner it's not critical to know exactly how to handle<br />
all of the raw materials in building a system. It is very critical however to be able<br />
understand intimately how every person in an organization does their job and how they<br />
manage information while at the same time being able to instantly jump up to 30,000<br />
feet and have a much broader view of the overall organization to be able to trade<br />
off functionality from one group of users to another, based on a benefit to the overall<br />
company, and then dive right back down into another particular user's day-to-day tasks<br />
in order to structure the system to help them do a better job. Being able to jump<br />
back out to the abstract, and then right back down to the concrete, and back and forth,<br />
is not a common skill in a lot of businesses, but it is critical that a product owner<br />
have this type of thinking ability.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 10px; margin-top: -8px;" title="Vision (Do you really have it?)" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/brightidea.jpg" alt="Vision (Do you really have it?)" /></p>
<ul>
<li>At Headspring, it's common for a client not to have that ability, and that is okay<br />
as that is one of the services we're here to provide. It's critical that we have it<br />
to help out a great number of our clients.</li>
<li>If a client does have the rare ability, that is fantastic. That client is well-positioned<br />
to analyze their needs and come to us much further along in the planning of that particular<br />
system than most other clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role of the product owner is very critical to the success of the system, not only<br />
from the responsibility of allocation of budget, but also to set expectations properly<br />
upfront for executive management, likely very concerned with where the organization's<br />
dollars are going and certainly expecting actual benefit that cannot be missed, not<br />
just paper status reports.</p>
<p>Headspring's clients often assume they don't have the technical expertise to construct<br />
software or write the lines of code that are required to make software work, and so<br />
they're often very willing to outsource that capability to us. But, in my experience,<br />
it's the value that a company like ours can provide in directing the construction<br />
of that software that can be a far more important service than the construction itself.</p>
<p>It's pretty clear that most companies, without prior experience in construction, wouldn't<br />
be comfortable, for example, drawing out the blueprints for their new office space<br />
or leading the team to actually construct from them or to make sure that all of the<br />
details are done on time, in the proper order, and to reasonable engineering specifications,<br />
and yet for many reasons we find that many clients do feel they are capable of performing<br />
the same role for a very large software implementation. Frankly, software implementations<br />
can be just as complex as large buildings with all of their plumbing, electricity,<br />
etc.</p>
<h2>Recommendation: Outsource the Product Owner</h2>
<p>For clients that have the expertise in and prior experience of building software effectively,<br />
we are excited to work with those kinds of individuals, but if you don't have that<br />
skill set and you don't have a history of constructing custom software applications,<br />
in my experience it is much better to outsource that competency to ensure greater<br />
success.</p>
