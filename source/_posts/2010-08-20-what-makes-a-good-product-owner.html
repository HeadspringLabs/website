What I've found is that the terms "product owner" and "subject matter expert" often
get confused with one another. A product owner ultimately should be responsible for
numerous things that a subject matter expert will not be qualified to handle such
as prioritization, constructing a vision for the product, and a timeline for which
to release the different modules of that eventual product. I see a product owner as
being the single source of requirements for a system which interacts with subject
matter experts and key stakeholders to produce the plan for building a product and
releasing it in phases. A product owner needs to be capable of interacting effectively
with business stakeholders, subject matter experts, and also a development construction
team.<!--more-->

The product owner role of prioritization, fielding estimates and modifying prior priorities
based on estimates is very critical and requires a very specific skill in order to
be done well.
<ul>
	<li>Many organizations don't have a need to keep that skill on their staff. It's just
not appropriate for a large number of businesses.</li>
	<li>But, an organization, more likely, may need to buy a business application or a records
management system to assist the business or to help manage information and the sharing
of it.</li>
	<li>At <a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>, we are most
successful in projects where we provide the product owner role, which then reports
to the client organization that brought us on to do the project.</li>
</ul>
<img style="float: left; padding: 3px 10px 3px 0px;" title="Product Owner" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/productowner.jpg" alt="Product Owner" />The
skill to understand the organization's needs and craft a solution, as well as to determine
what to trade off of the expenses for a return on investment, and to determine what
to do when, who to serve first, and what to defer, is critical to ensuring the success
of a project. This skill overlaps quite a bit with the skill that a software architect
will have, but for a product owner it's not critical to know exactly how to handle
all of the raw materials in building a system. It is very critical however to be able
understand intimately how every person in an organization does their job and how they
manage information while at the same time being able to instantly jump up to 30,000
feet and have a much broader view of the overall organization to be able to trade
off functionality from one group of users to another, based on a benefit to the overall
company, and then dive right back down into another particular user's day-to-day tasks
in order to structure the system to help them do a better job. Being able to jump
back out to the abstract, and then right back down to the concrete, and back and forth,
is not a common skill in a lot of businesses, but it is critical that a product owner
have this type of thinking ability.

<ul>
	<li>At Headspring, it's common for a client not to have that ability, and that is okay
as that is one of the services we're here to provide. It's critical that we have it
to help out a great number of our clients.</li>
	<li>If a client does have the rare ability, that is fantastic. That client is well-positioned
to analyze their needs and come to us much further along in the planning of that particular
system than most other clients.</li>
</ul>
The role of the product owner is very critical to the success of the system, not only
from the responsibility of allocation of budget, but also to set expectations properly
upfront for executive management, likely very concerned with where the organization's
dollars are going and certainly expecting actual benefit that cannot be missed, not
just paper status reports.

Headspring's clients often assume they don't have the technical expertise to construct
software or write the lines of code that are required to make software work, and so
they're often very willing to outsource that capability to us. But, in my experience,
it's the value that a company like ours can provide in directing the construction
of that software that can be a far more important service than the construction itself.

It's pretty clear that most companies, without prior experience in construction, wouldn't
be comfortable, for example, drawing out the blueprints for their new office space
or leading the team to actually construct from them or to make sure that all of the
details are done on time, in the proper order, and to reasonable engineering specifications,
and yet for many reasons we find that many clients do feel they are capable of performing
the same role for a very large software implementation. Frankly, software implementations
can be just as complex as large buildings with all of their plumbing, electricity,
etc.
<h2>Recommendation: Outsource the Product Owner</h2>
For clients that have the expertise in and prior experience of building software effectively,
we are excited to work with those kinds of individuals, but if you don't have that
skill set and you don't have a history of constructing custom software applications,
in my experience it is much better to outsource that competency to ensure greater
success.
