Deran Schilling, Senior Consultant at Headspring,  is new to the team, and we have warmly welcomed him in as an additional web technology and design enthusiast.  After working in education for several years at LSU Alexandria, and Clear Creek ISD, Deran has gracefully transitioned to the corporate world and the Austin tech community.  So far, he has lead a team of Headspringers to participate in this year’s <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/headspring-shows-some-love-at-knowbilitys-austin-air">Knowbility Austin AIR</a>, and has plans for more events and competitions this year.  Here is some of our conversation:

<strong>What led you to software development?<!--more--></strong>

In high school, I planned to be a band director, but ended up in a programming class my senior year.  From that point on, I was going to be a developer.  Lucky for me the college I chose has a great music program and CIS program.

<strong>Do you like teaching?</strong>

Yes I do.  In my previous jobs, I would always offer up different training sessions from MVC to jQuery to SQL to CSS to whatever they asked to learn about.  I firmly believe that you don’t fully understand something until you can teach it.  Occasionally, I call some of my developer friends to tell them about something new I learned.  In the conversation, I can determine if I really understand it.  If they ask a lot of questions that I can’t answer, I know I need to learn more.  Hopefully they don’t read this post and know they’re my guinea pigs.

<strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong>

It depends on what I’m learning because I have different approaches for various things, but if we’re talking about a new technology then I gauge my co-workers and some reviews on whether or not it’s even worth learning.  If it is, I’ll jump into Google and find some blog posts.  If I can’t find any blog posts, I’ll buy the book.   If there is no book, I’ll figure it out myself and then blog about it.  This way, there will be a post that other people and myself can reference.

<strong>How do you gauge “time well spent?”</strong>

I gauge it based on how much value was brought to the company or to a relationship.  I value the time in the break room or at our lunches because carefully built relationships are important to a healthy team.  One of the main reasons I wanted to come to Headspring is because they seem very people-oriented.  We all work out of the Headspring office, which I think makes for a stronger team, and we are involved in the community.
