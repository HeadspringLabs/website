We see a lot of clients that wish to try to commercialize the applications that they've
built and to try to get some additional revenue from them or to create a spin-off
business offering the product to other industry competitors. While they're offering
their competitive advantage to others that might compete with them, they are always
ahead of the curve because they are the ones producing the software and they are the
ones innovating it. They are the ones that are continuing to make it better.

Software commercialization is one area some clients see as a strategic advantage in
the long-term, either as a spin-off company or in the name of building a product to
help them garner possibilities for an "exit situation" in which a company is sold
because it has a proprietary system that allows it to run more efficiently than others.

In building a custom application one might ask:<!--more-->
<ul>
	<li>Do I want to commercialize this later and possibly monetize it?</li>
	<li>Is this a strategic advantage that we can use when we're exiting the company or trying
to sell the company?</li>
</ul>

<h2>How much to build...</h2>
Let's dive into what happens when you decide to make <a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/2010/12/24/BuildVersusBuy.aspx" target="_blank">the
build decision versus the buy decision</a>. (The application is core to your business
and there is not a package off the shelf that is going to meet your needs, hence you
decide to build.) One approach is to build the whole thing, but that is rarely the
correct choice because if you look at the overall scope of what you want to build
and it has scope encompassing people, customers, and how your business operates, there
are probably going to be:
<ul>
	<li>pieces for scheduling</li>
	<li>pieces that list contacts</li>
	<li>some sort of product and services list</li>
	<li>some tasking and workflow around how people do what they do</li>
</ul>
There are a lot of smaller packages to manage these items out in the wild. And you
may utilize them as, while the entire system, as a whole, may be unique, you have
made a decision to build a unique application, not an application of 100% unique scope.
There is always a portion of a sizable system, and sometimes a significant portion,
that may be comprised of a number of smaller packages integrated together so that
perhaps only 50 to 70 percent of the overall scope need be custom built. Some of the
other pieces may be small, targeted, off-the-shelf packages that are integrated into
the overall solution.

There are really two different ways to approach a partially-built package:
<ol>
	<li>One is buying a package and customizing it. That's not necessarily the best option
a lot of times. These are hard to make successful in a lot of situations, because
the package that one is to customize will often not have a great deal of ways to interface
with it seamlessly.</li>
	<li>The other is specifically building a <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/custom-application-development/" target="_blank">custom
application</a> and then finding opportunities to buy components to plug into that
custom framework. A good example of that might be reporting. We don't need to reinvent
graphing, charting, and reporting, but we do have data to display and we need to be
able to make it look a certain way. This is a great example of a situation in which
one should pull something "off the shelf" to give very robust reporting functionality
for a fraction of the cost that it would take to actually build the reporting. This
approach helps get the cost of the build down and still gives a lot of functionality.</li>
</ol>
