<p>We see a lot of clients that wish to try to commercialize the applications that they've<br />
built and to try to get some additional revenue from them or to create a spin-off<br />
business offering the product to other industry competitors. While they're offering<br />
their competitive advantage to others that might compete with them, they are always<br />
ahead of the curve because they are the ones producing the software and they are the<br />
ones innovating it. They are the ones that are continuing to make it better.</p>
<p>Software commercialization is one area some clients see as a strategic advantage in<br />
the long-term, either as a spin-off company or in the name of building a product to<br />
help them garner possibilities for an "exit situation" in which a company is sold<br />
because it has a proprietary system that allows it to run more efficiently than others.</p>
<p>In building a custom application one might ask:<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>Do I want to commercialize this later and possibly monetize it?</li>
<li>Is this a strategic advantage that we can use when we're exiting the company or trying<br />
to sell the company?</li>
</ul>

<h2>How much to build...</h2>
<p>Let's dive into what happens when you decide to make <a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/2010/12/24/BuildVersusBuy.aspx" target="_blank">the<br />
build decision versus the buy decision</a>. (The application is core to your business<br />
and there is not a package off the shelf that is going to meet your needs, hence you<br />
decide to build.) One approach is to build the whole thing, but that is rarely the<br />
correct choice because if you look at the overall scope of what you want to build<br />
and it has scope encompassing people, customers, and how your business operates, there<br />
are probably going to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>pieces for scheduling</li>
<li>pieces that list contacts</li>
<li>some sort of product and services list</li>
<li>some tasking and workflow around how people do what they do</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of smaller packages to manage these items out in the wild. And you<br />
may utilize them as, while the entire system, as a whole, may be unique, you have<br />
made a decision to build a unique application, not an application of 100% unique scope.<br />
There is always a portion of a sizable system, and sometimes a significant portion,<br />
that may be comprised of a number of smaller packages integrated together so that<br />
perhaps only 50 to 70 percent of the overall scope need be custom built. Some of the<br />
other pieces may be small, targeted, off-the-shelf packages that are integrated into<br />
the overall solution.</p>
<p>There are really two different ways to approach a partially-built package:</p>
<ol>
<li>One is buying a package and customizing it. That's not necessarily the best option<br />
a lot of times. These are hard to make successful in a lot of situations, because<br />
the package that one is to customize will often not have a great deal of ways to interface<br />
with it seamlessly.</li>
<li>The other is specifically building a <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/custom-application-development/" target="_blank">custom<br />
application</a> and then finding opportunities to buy components to plug into that<br />
custom framework. A good example of that might be reporting. We don't need to reinvent<br />
graphing, charting, and reporting, but we do have data to display and we need to be<br />
able to make it look a certain way. This is a great example of a situation in which<br />
one should pull something "off the shelf" to give very robust reporting functionality<br />
for a fraction of the cost that it would take to actually build the reporting. This<br />
approach helps get the cost of the build down and still gives a lot of functionality.</li>
</ol>
