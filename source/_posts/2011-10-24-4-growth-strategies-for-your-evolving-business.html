<p>Entrepreneurs are constantly looking for business growth strategies, especially when the business is evolving and improving. Here are four things to help lead entrepreneurs on the best path to growth and success and examples of how we implement these strategies at Headspring.</p>
<p><strong>1. Improve your leadership</strong></p>
<p>Review how you lead your team and find opportunities to improve it. The solution could be classes or getting involved in professional <!--more-->organizations to help you learn new best practices. Do you meet with each employee on a regular basis? You could also change your review process with your employees and find new ways to support them.</p>
<p>At Headspring, employees meet with their supervisor for a one-on-one once a month. This is a chance to discuss anything the employee or supervisor wants to. This is also a great way to encourage a collaborative and team environment.</p>
<p><strong>2. Review your business goals</strong></p>
<p>As your business evolves, your end goal may evolve also. It’s important to periodically review your business goals to keep your focus and actions aligned. Is your company still on the right track to success or do you need to shift the goals? Take in consideration your progress so far and where you want to be in the future.</p>
<p>Every quarter, our entire company meets to discuss the company’s goals, evaluate where we are, and discuss where we are headed. Then, we go spend time outside of the office doing something fun – i.e. rock climbing, laser tag, Segway tours, etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Diversify your offerings</strong></p>
<p>Expand and diversify your offerings based on your clients’ needs. What other services or products can you offer? Think about how you can improve your clients’ experience or meet their needs. Complementary products, educational webinars and white papers or internal improvements of processes with clients can help improve and grow your business.</p>
<p>Our developers and team frequently develops open source projects, hosts numerous training and education seminars and focus on providing systems that will help our clients’ businesses grow.</p>
<p><strong>4. Develop the skills of your employees</strong></p>
<p>Are your employees improving their skills and continuing their education? When your employees improve and expand their skills, it allows them to improve their quality of work at your company, which will make your company more successful. Your company can offer company educational or seminar days for your employees or you can provide your employees with a list of options, such as classes offered in your city or educational events employees can attend.</p>
<p>We continuously encourage and support mastering a skill. We’ve built in CI time daily for employees and host peer learning lunches, which allow them to focus on anything they choose that they want to master and share what they’ve learned with the entire office.</p>
<p>What business growth strategies do you use?</p>
