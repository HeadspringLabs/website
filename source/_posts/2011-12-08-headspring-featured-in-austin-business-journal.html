<h2>The start-up story of Dustin Wells and Headspring featured in the Entrepreneur Connection section</h2>
<p><strong>Austin, Texas - February 19, 2010</strong> - Austin Business Journal has written <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/community/EntrepreneurConnection.pdf" target="_blank">an article on Headspring</a> and how Dustin Wells, Headspring's Founder and CEO, started and grew the business to one of the fastest growing privately-held companies in America. It outlines the humble beginnings and shares tips about how he grew Headspring to its present standing. Headspring has been recognized as the 127th fastest growing privately-held business in the United States (Inc. Magazine, 8/12/2009) and the 3rd fastest growing privately-held business in Austin (Austin Business Journal, 11/13/2009). This feature article appears in the Feb. 19-25, 2010 issue.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to be recognized by the Austin Business Journal and that our story could be shared with others," Dustin comments. "Starting a new business is a very difficult, and taxing endeavor. The Austin community and their support for local business has made the leap much easier and has made success more attainable."</p>
<p>The article appears in Austin Business Journal's "Entrepreneur Connection" section which had until January of 2010 been a section titled "Strategies." The modern Entrepreneur Connection attempts to speak to Austin's entrepreneurial community by offering an exposition on an entrepreneur's business story. A question based on the article and posed to a panel of business executives is given with panelist answers in a sidebar within Entrepreneur Connection titled "Ask the Experts."</p>
<p>Austin Business Journal is the Austin, Texas market newspaper within the American City Business Journals newspaper chain which provides to numerous American cities business-related weekly news publications.</p>
