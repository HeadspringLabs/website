<p><strong>What made you want to work here?</strong></p>
<p>I like working with people that get excited about what they are doing, and I believe that passion leads to pushing the boundaries of what is possible. I see a lot of that passion in the team at Headspring. Anyone who has worked with or for the company has a great standard for technical excellence, an attitude of sharing and learning, and they are passionate about their discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to clients, I like providing solutions that make complex problems seem easy. I like to make tools for people to remove frustrations in the little things they have to do to perform their jobs and enjoy building software for someone to help achieve that goal.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>Communicating with people. I come from roots in graphic design and enjoy conveying ideas to people. Naturally, designing for the web became a necessity and so a few Wrox books later I was well into the world of developing software for the web. Also, programming is fun!</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>A lot. It’s fun to plan out a frame of time and present a topic to a room of people. I like setting the pacing and revealing information to people in a way that can both get them excited and present them with practical knowledge. Mentoring is another great avenue for that. I try very hard to mentor others, as well as find someone to learn from myself. The philosophy of experiential education emphasizes the pattern “see one, do one, teach one”, and I try to keep that active as much as I can.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>Anytime something is produced, learned, improved or passion is rekindled. Shipping viable software or improving it based on features that are in use is an obvious good use of time.</p>
