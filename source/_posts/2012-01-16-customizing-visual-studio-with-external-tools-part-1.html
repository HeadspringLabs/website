Visual Studio has some deep customization options and extensibility points that many of us just ignore. Once such option is “External Tools” which allow you to create a menu item (and optional toolbar) that can run any external program you wish.

I recently had to set up a couple of new computing environments so I went through my typical routine of setting up <em>Explorer.exe</em> as an external tool, and while doing so I pondered a few other tools that might be useful. In this and subsequent posts, I’ll describe how to set up some simple external tools, create a custom tool bar for them and even add them to the context menu.<!--more-->

In your menu, go to <strong>Tools &gt; External Tools</strong>. You may already have some present like Dotfuscator or a Guid generator.

Setting up a tool is fairly simple: You can see above I have Windows Explorer configured with the /select argument to select the file based on the $(ItemPath) variable. More on this on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ekbzk5f8.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN – Arguments for External Tools</a>. When you launch this tool it will open Explorer to the currently active/selected file (either in your editor or the one selected in your solution explorer). I find it a handy shortcut when I need to explore to a file deep within a solution.
<h2>Other External Tools</h2>
I recently added my other favorite editor, <em>Notepad++,</em> to my tools.  Instead of exploring to the currently active file, it will open it up in Notepad++ which is where I find myself editing project files, csv files and other documents that I don’t need to edit with Visual Studio. You can configure Notepad++ with:

<strong>Title</strong>: Notepad++ (or anything you wish)

<strong>Command</strong>: C:Program Files (x86)Notepad++notepad++.exe (location of the exe)

<strong>Arguments</strong>: $(ItemPath)

At Headspring, we use the open-source <a href="https://bitbucket.org/headspringlabs/tarantino/wiki/Home" target="_blank">Tarantino Project</a> to deploy many of our applications. On some projects the deployer executable resides somewhere in a <em>lib</em> folder within the project which means you have to walk through at least a few directories to get to it. I recently made a batch file to launch it straight from the command line from the root of a project, and so I went ahead and turned this .bat file into an external tool while I was at it.

<strong>Title</strong>: Tarantino Deployer

<strong>Command</strong>: $(SolutionDir)..Deploy.bat

<strong>Arguments</strong>: /min (this hides the cmd window)

The Deploy.bat file sites in the same folder as the .sln file does and simply points to the relative location of the deployer exe:

@echo off
Start /D.libdeployer .libdeployerTarantino.Deployer.exe
<h2>Launching External Tools</h2>
Once you’ve set up your tools in the dialog shown above, they will appear in your tools menu like so:

Stay tuned for more! In the next post I’ll walk you through making your own custom Visual Studio toolbar to contain your tools.
