<p>Custom software projects are hard. The Standish Group reported in 2009 that only 33% of software projects are successful! Ouch. There are many strategies to ensure successful delivery of custom software projects. One is strongly related to the relationship between the provider and the client and how the parties work together to respond when a problem arises. How this response is handled sets the tone for either a long-term healthy relationship or a one-time customer. A strong, positive response leads to client retention.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago, Headspring made a radically unique decision that in retrospect, unlocked our future growth.  We focused all of our efforts on <strong>keeping every single client</strong> that we get. In order to achieve this, it was imperative for us to start by doing the following two things:<!--more--></p>
<p>1)      Find a good culture fit between our clients and us. This gives the relationship a head start and helps us be better aligned with the client’s need and goals</p>
<p>2)      Ensure our client’s needs are mapped directly to our core competencies so we are in a position to add the maximum amount of value possible.</p>
<p>We called this the “Get New, Keep Existing” strategy.  It sounds simple, but it is alarming how many companies have trouble with this and never realize that this is the key to their future growth.</p>
<p>Working only with clients to whom you can bring value is important.  It is our sales team’s responsibility to seek other companies that will gain value from our core competencies and that will be a strong culture fit for us and our core values – like honest communication and drive for excellence.  By finding clients who gain value from your core competencies, it will lead to a more transparent exchange.  Bottom line is that we must be a good fit for <strong>each other</strong>.</p>
<p>Our goal at Headspring is to pioneer the “no surprises” movement in the custom software industry. Strong communication and a win/win attitude will keep both parties from unreasonably high or incorrect expectations.  There is no sense in pushing a product or a service on a client when it doesn’t fit their needs.</p>
<p>Once the fit is established, and the work has begun, good account management is one strategy that mitigates the risk of a project failing, and increases the chance that the client will return for more services.  It establishes a strong relationship that gives clients a greater level of comfort in sharing candid feedback.  In addition, it provides a strong foundation to solve tough problems that will arise with any custom software project. I have mapped out a few techniques, like the Rule of Three, in my <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/account-management-taking-off-the-rosecolored-glasses">previous blog</a>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and we have seen dramatic growth, attributing a great deal of our progress to the simple “Get New, Keep Existing” approach.</p>
<p>What if you focused all of your resources and people on getting the right clients, and keeping the ones you have?</p>
