<p>At this point in the holiday season, you may be scrambling for gift giving ideas.  Who better than tried and true techies to weigh in on the must-have gadgets for the New Year. Scoop them up for someone you love or put them on your wish list!  Here are some ideas from the Headspring Development team.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse </strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Jimmy Bogard</em><strong></strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6272" title="atmafrontcurvedfy111" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/atmafrontcurvedfy111-395x300.jpeg" alt="" width="395" height="300" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/arc-touch-mouse" target="_blank">Arc Touch Mouse by Microsoft</a> is a sleek, wireless, and reliable tool that will improve the fluidity of work. It features the high-tech Touch strip technology that makes use precise. A fringe benefit for business and pleasure travel is the mouse can be flattened for easy storage!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arduino Microcontroller</strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Sharon Cichelli</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6273" title="300px-Arduino316" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/300px-Arduino316.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="209" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino microcontroller</a> is a great introduction to programming and electronics. Designed to be affordable and approachable, it opens the door for inspiring the next generation of developers.  It’s also great for building cool stuff as you work on fun projects with your sweetie or kids. It is open-source hardware supported by open-source software and a rich community of tinkerers who are happy to share their knowledge and get you started.</p>

<p><strong>Kindle Paperwhite</strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Anne Epstein</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6274" title="MG_7921-660x439" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MG_7921-660x439-451x300.jpeg" alt="" width="451" height="300" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Touch-light/dp/B007OZNZG0" target="_blank">newest version of Kindle</a>, the “world’s most advanced e-reader,” features: higher resolution, higher contrast touchscreen, built-in light and an 8-week battery life. An improved screen, the ability for nighttime reading, and Amazon’s expansive e-book selection makes the Kindle Paperwhite a sought-after gadget this holiday!</p>
