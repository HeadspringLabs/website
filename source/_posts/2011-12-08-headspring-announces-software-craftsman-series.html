<strong>Weekly sessions will provide ongoing training for Austin-area developers.</strong>

<strong>Austin, Texas - December 14, 2010 -</strong> As part of an ongoing commitment to support the Austin-area developer community, Headspring is proud to announce the beginning of the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/services/developer-training/software-craftsman/">Software Craftsman Series</a>. These sessions will be held weekly from 8:30 to 10:00 AM on Tuesday mornings beginning January 4th. Teaching the classes will be Microsoft MVP and Headspring CIO Jeffrey Palermo. The topics will progress weekly, covering advanced development and testing techniques, database change management, agile methodologies, and more.

Mr. Palermo is a nationally regarded expert in software management and developer coaching. He is also the lead author of <a href="http://www.manning.com/palermo2/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC 2 in Action</a>. "Large software labs have the benefit of moving programmers around and spreading knowledge," Palermo commented. "This program brings some of the same benefits to members of smaller teams. The topics are relevant and always fresh."

Seats are available on a subscription basis, enabling software managers to send appropriate team members based on each week's topic. The classes will be held at Headspring's offices located at 4807 Spicewood Springs Road, Building 4, Suite 201 Austin, TX 78759. To register, contact Headspring at (512) 459-2260 or visit <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">www.headspring.com</a>.
