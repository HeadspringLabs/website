Several web redesigns have been coming out recently, so I put together a quick recap of the ones I am most excited about.

1.YouTube

YouTube's redesign focuses mainly around making their channels more attractive to users.  The homepage now features a bar on the left with a list of subscribed and suggested channels, and a feed in the center.  Other featured videos are in a bar on the right, versus front and center on the previous design.

Another great benefit is the long overdue integration with Google accounts and social media.  It's no longer necessary for new users to create an account if they have Gmail.  Visitors already logged into their Google account, are automatically logged in when they visit the homepage.  Who needs to remember another log in or password?  Also, Google+ and Facebook get prime spots in the navigation bar.

This video explains all the new features in under two minutes:<!--more-->

2.  Twitter

Twitter's most notable new features are the "me" and "discover" tabs.  Overall, a more comprehensive experience can be expected.

The "me" tab allows a user to introduce themselves to their profile visitors, allowing users to identify themselves past who they are following and where they are from.  This feature also allows followers to Tweet directly to you based on the provided information.  Direct messaging has also been redirected to this tab. The new "discover" tab will steam hashtagged and trending topics based on your interests, shared content, and location.

3. ASP.NET

Finally, after much adieu, ASP.NET has chosen to focus on providing more tutorials, and has made them easier to find.  The site has also undergone a major clutter-cleaning, making it more navigable in general.  Content is now organized based on relevancy. Also, the onboarding experience has been greatly improved.  The homepage definitely feels more inviting than before.  Lastly, the stream in the middle spotlights visitors with useful information about what's going on in the community.
