Are the traditional executive division lines of CEO, COO, CIO, CFO, and CTO a good
model for leadership at a services company? How may the model be refined specific
to the software space?

This takes us back to the prior posting about <a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/2010/10/18/FocusOnYourCoreCompetencyOutsourceEverythingElse.aspx">outsourcing</a>.

Depending on your size, of course, you might need all of those roles but that is definitely
overkill for a company that lists, say, in the five to twenty five million range (where
you don't need all of those executive positions). Companies annually earning hundreds
of millions and up might need all of those. It really comes down to: <span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">Who
is the executive team now?</span> Is it the founders or are they hired in? What does
that "look like?" What are their skill sets?

If applicable, do not be scared to hire people smarter than yourself to come in and
take the reins of some things.<!--more-->

Which of the before mentioned roles is most important for your core competency and
what you're good at? For <a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>,
it's really important that we have a CIO and a Chief Architect, because we develop
software solutions as our core competency. We don't have a full time CFO. That's not
required to be successful in our business, so we outsource that to a virtual CFO.
And so, I think it varies on what types of services you're delivering and what your
actual core competency is as to what executive team you might need for support.

Could a services company outsource its CTO role to a software vendor? Is the relationship
between a good software vendor and its client a partnership between two companies?
I think the answer to that question is unequivocally yes.

In our experience, our strongest partnerships were great successes, and in the kind
of engagement, we typically engage in, both halves (our client and then us, as a service
company) really have a lot to bring to the table.

The service company has the intimate knowledge of their business and the strong idea
of their goals and where they're heading, while a company like ours brings, obviously
the technical side, but also a long history of taking ideas and goals and issues the
company is facing and turning those items into solutions (whether they be technology
focused or simple changes to repetitive existing business processes).
<h2>From Vendor to Partner</h2>
How does one cross the line?

How do you become a trusted adviser?

One of the focuses that I like to see with our partners is of: <em>"Are we hiring
a vendor or is this someone that really intimately knows our business and can help
make us successful in the future?"</em> We like to try to mirror that with our clients
as well, and make sure we have intimate knowledge of what's going on, and what their
goals are so that we may find other areas to add value instead of just coming in and
executing on a tactical piece of the puzzle.

In terms of building trust and crossing the chasm from vendor to trusted advisor:
<ol>
	<li>The best way I think we've found to do that is to deliver value to the client as early
as possible and as often as possible to really earn trust. Instead of, for example,
going through eight or ninety percent of a client's budget before they can really
utilize the deliverables we're producing, we would prefer to go more like ten or twenty
percent into the client's budget before they can actually deploy that software and
begin using it in production. In our experience when we do that, we quickly build
trust and get to that partnership mode, where we're working together with our client
to meet their organization's objectives.</li>
	<li>The other critical thing is executive stakeholder involvement, from both teams. So
from our team we have to have people at our highest levels involved with the client
in understanding what their business is in an intimate basis. From the client's side,
we have to have the involvement from their CEO, and their CIO, or their COO, some
of their executive team members as well. This shows a big commitment on both sides,
that both sides are serious about the relationship and trying to make sure that they
may move forward as closely-minded as possible.</li>
