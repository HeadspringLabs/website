<p>Are the traditional executive division lines of CEO, COO, CIO, CFO, and CTO a good<br />
model for leadership at a services company? How may the model be refined specific<br />
to the software space?</p>
<p>This takes us back to the prior posting about <a href="http://blogs.headspring.com/2010/10/18/FocusOnYourCoreCompetencyOutsourceEverythingElse.aspx">outsourcing</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on your size, of course, you might need all of those roles but that is definitely<br />
overkill for a company that lists, say, in the five to twenty five million range (where<br />
you don't need all of those executive positions). Companies annually earning hundreds<br />
of millions and up might need all of those. It really comes down to: <span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">Who<br />
is the executive team now?</span> Is it the founders or are they hired in? What does<br />
that "look like?" What are their skill sets?</p>
<p>If applicable, do not be scared to hire people smarter than yourself to come in and<br />
take the reins of some things.</p>

<p>Which of the before mentioned roles is most important for your core competency and<br />
what you're good at? For <a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a>,<br />
it's really important that we have a CIO and a Chief Architect, because we develop<br />
software solutions as our core competency. We don't have a full time CFO. That's not<br />
required to be successful in our business, so we outsource that to a virtual CFO.<br />
And so, I think it varies on what types of services you're delivering and what your<br />
actual core competency is as to what executive team you might need for support.</p>
<p>Could a services company outsource its CTO role to a software vendor? Is the relationship<br />
between a good software vendor and its client a partnership between two companies?<br />
I think the answer to that question is unequivocally yes.</p>
<p>In our experience, our strongest partnerships were great successes, and in the kind<br />
of engagement, we typically engage in, both halves (our client and then us, as a service<br />
company) really have a lot to bring to the table.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;" title="virtual CTO" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/virtualCTO.gif" alt="virtual CTO" /></p>
<p>The service company has the intimate knowledge of their business and the strong idea<br />
of their goals and where they're heading, while a company like ours brings, obviously<br />
the technical side, but also a long history of taking ideas and goals and issues the<br />
company is facing and turning those items into solutions (whether they be technology<br />
focused or simple changes to repetitive existing business processes).</p>
<h2>From Vendor to Partner</h2>
<p>How does one cross the line?</p>
<p>How do you become a trusted adviser?</p>
<p>One of the focuses that I like to see with our partners is of: <em>"Are we hiring<br />
a vendor or is this someone that really intimately knows our business and can help<br />
make us successful in the future?"</em> We like to try to mirror that with our clients<br />
as well, and make sure we have intimate knowledge of what's going on, and what their<br />
goals are so that we may find other areas to add value instead of just coming in and<br />
executing on a tactical piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>In terms of building trust and crossing the chasm from vendor to trusted advisor:</p>
<ol>
<li>The best way I think we've found to do that is to deliver value to the client as early<br />
as possible and as often as possible to really earn trust. Instead of, for example,<br />
going through eight or ninety percent of a client's budget before they can really<br />
utilize the deliverables we're producing, we would prefer to go more like ten or twenty<br />
percent into the client's budget before they can actually deploy that software and<br />
begin using it in production. In our experience when we do that, we quickly build<br />
trust and get to that partnership mode, where we're working together with our client<br />
to meet their organization's objectives.</li>
<li>The other critical thing is executive stakeholder involvement, from both teams. So<br />
from our team we have to have people at our highest levels involved with the client<br />
in understanding what their business is in an intimate basis. From the client's side,<br />
we have to have the involvement from their CEO, and their CIO, or their COO, some<br />
of their executive team members as well. This shows a big commitment on both sides,<br />
that both sides are serious about the relationship and trying to make sure that they<br />
may move forward as closely-minded as possible.</li>
</ol>
