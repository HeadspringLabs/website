<b>What did you do before coming to Headspring?</b>

I worked at a pharmaceutical research company and analyzed statistics, trends, patterns, and data. I enjoy working with numbers, so joining Headspring’s Business Development department was a great fit.

<b>What attracted you to work at Headspring?</b>

Great corporate culture. Headspring recruits highly talented people and the opportunity to work around very intelligent people made it appealing. The job description and career progression are very straightforward and match my career goals.

<b>How do you gauge “time well spent?”</b>

Any time you look back and say you wouldn’t have done it differently, or doing something you enjoy that also brings long-term goodness or benefit.<em id="__mceDel"> </em>

<b>What is your role at Headspring?</b>

I’m focused on developing business in the Houston market. I’m defining and developing the working markets and building relationships with existing and potential clients.

<b>What do you hope to accomplish professionally and personally in the next 5 years?</b>

I care about Headspring and am invested in the company and people. I want to help Headspring grow. I also want to grow and increase my level of responsibility.

<b>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?</b>

I love sports and watch ESPN a lot. Besides sailing, I play in a lacrosse league. I also enjoy playing chess, reading and all outdoor activities.

<b>What’s a tool or gadget you can’t live without?</b>

My headlamp. It’s invaluable when you’re in the dark. I always have it with me. I used it to change a sparkplug under the car hood the other day.

<b>What’s a piece of wisdom or advice you live by?</b>

I don’t believe things happen for a reason but I believe in making the best of the situation when it does happen.
