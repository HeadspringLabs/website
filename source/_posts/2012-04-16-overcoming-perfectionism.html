<blockquote><p><em>Perfectionist (my rough definition):  Someone who wants to always do things without errors or mistakes, without considering the costs incurred or likelihood of attainment.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article I share my personal struggles with unproductive perfectionism in my work.  I point out how much “true perfection” really costs, and that it often isn’t even possible.  I discuss why overcoming perfectionism is important, and share some strategies I’ve found useful for balancing passion and perfectionism.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Nolan and I’m a recovering perfectionist.  I love software development and I’m very passionate about what I do.  The problem is, sometimes I care too much and passion turns into perfectionism.</p>
<p>I started thinking about this after my first post.  I was checking it to see if there were any comments I needed to respond to.  I’d written the article over a week before it was published, so I casually glanced over it.  While reading I suddenly realized I’d completely left a word out of a sentence.  I was mortified.  I’d proofread it at least three times and had gotten someone else to look over it.  How could this have happened?  My first blog post and I’d failed to do it “right”.<!--more--></p>
<p>It wasn’t a big error.  <em>Fun contest: I’ll send some Headspring swag to the first commenter that finds the word omission in </em><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/making-conditional-validation-logic-readable" target="_blank"><em>that post</em></a>.  But it felt big, and I felt it reflected badly on me.  “How can I write posts that help others when I communicate so poorly?” I wondered.</p>
<p>Last night I got an email from an old colleague that I haven’t talked with for almost two years.  He wrote “…I saw your post.  Really enjoyed reading it.  Nice job!”</p>
<p>Isn’t this ironic?  Here I was despondent about my ability to write in an understandable fashion, when in reality people are finding the article useful despite the error.  It was so encouraging to get that email.</p>
<h2>Self Reflection</h2>
<p>I’ve spent some time looking back over my career, and I can see some examples of times when I’ve let perfectionism run a little too wild:</p>
<ul>
<li>Striving for very high code coverage with automated tests, regardless of the cost of writing and maintaining those tests compared to the risks of the covered code becoming broken.</li>
<li>Defensive coding to a superfluous level.  For example, having a public class method perform input validation before calling a private method, and then having the private method perform the same validation.</li>
<li>Crafting a long email with all the relevant details and background when it would have been quicker to just go talk to the individual in person.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a few minutes and reflect back on your life about something you are passionate about – software, cooking, or perhaps golf.  Try to look in a detached, unemotional manner – do you ever strive for an unreasonably high standard?</p>
<h2>Is Perfection Even Possible?</h2>
<p>If there’s any organization that has to “get it right”, it’s the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  They design space vehicles controlled by software responsible for safely flying humans into and back from space.  Vehicle failure doesn’t mean walking home, it means not coming home.  While NASA has had fatal accidents, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/flyfeature_shuttlecomputers.html" target="_blank">none of them were caused by software.</a></p>
<p>So how did NASA ensure that a system where each software change that goes through 15 months of testing is perfect?  They assumed it might not be perfect and paid a different company to create a <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/shutref/orbiter/avionics/dps/bfs.html" target="_blank">backup flight control</a> with a completely different implementation.</p>
<h2>Why Overcoming Perfectionism Is Important</h2>
<p>There are at least two reasons why it’s important to overcome perfectionist tendencies:  cost, and your personal well-being.</p>
<p>“More perfect” means more costly with no substantial benefit.  You wouldn’t buy a $500 toothpick because it was made from teak wood and hand carved and sanded into the perfect shape, would you?  Likewise you need to be aware of the cost of what you’re doing for your company or client and if they’re getting value out of the effort your expending.</p>
<p>Secondly, perfectionism is dangerous to your mental health.  It's good to care, but it's bad to care so much you feel inadequate.  Overcoming perfectionism doesn't mean you stop caring, it means adjusting to a healthier perspective.  The danger in not overcoming the agony of not reaching perfection is slipping into cynicism about the glass "always being half empty" and a general sense of depression about not reaching your goals.</p>
<h2>Strategies For Overcoming Perfectionism</h2>
<p>These are a few strategies I’ve found helpful in dealing with perfectionist tendencies. If you have some others, please add a comment to share it.</p>
<p>Seek a crystal clear understanding of the context for the work you’re doing.  How will this be used, and how much "quality" do we need?  Test cases help.  Recognize that dealing with edge cases can add significant work, figure out the cost and make sure it's worth the effort.</p>
<p>If at all possible, don’t work alone.  Use others as a sounding board to make sure you haven’t gone overboard in a design or implementation.  You’ll get positive feedback from someone else, and seeing others struggle at times and assisting them helps you realize we’re all human and keeps you from expecting too much from yourself.</p>
<p>Don’t try to plan everything up front.  Have a rough idea of what you need and start top down and adjust as needed.  If you try to plan every last detail before you start, you’ll never start.</p>
<p>When you make a mistake, don’t dwell on it.  Give yourself credit for how hard and demanding software development really is.  Natural language can be understood even when misteaks are maid, but in programs ONE LITTLE CHARACTER makes something right or wrong.</p>
<p>Celebrate your accomplishments! It’s important to analyze your mistakes and learn from them, but it’s just as important to reflect and revel in your successes.</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Randy Pausch was a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University.  When he found out he had terminal cancer, he gave an incredibly uplifting speech reflecting on what’s really important in life.  The speech was expanded into a book titled “The Last Lecture”.  One observation Randy made that really grabbed my attention was this:  <strong>“Engineering isn't about perfect solutions; it's about doing the best you can with limited resources”</strong>.  Randy faced the ultimate "it can't be perfect" scenario by not being able to live the average lifespan most of us assume we'll get.  He courageously dealt with it the best he could, and is an inspiration to the rest of us.</p>
<p>Your work doesn’t have to be perfect – rarely CAN it be perfect, and recognizing this doesn’t mean giving up on your passion for doing things well.  Getting over perfectionism enables you to do more things and be a happier person.</p>
