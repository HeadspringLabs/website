<p>This week’s spotlight is on Ryan Vice, one of our newest Principal Consultants at Headspring.  He is currently in the final stages of authoring, <em>MVVM Survival Guide for Enterprise Architectures in WPF and Silverlight</em>.  Here is our conversation:</p>
<p><strong>What led to you focusing on WPF?</strong></p>
<p>During my time at Money Management International, I was the Workflow lead and that position included the responsibility for both the workflow engine and the related user interface components.  During that time I became active on the MSDN Workflow Foundation forums and was one of the top answerers throughout that year. This lead to me being offered a slot at Houston’s Tech Fest, which lead to blog content which then lead to me receiving Microsoft MVP award in connected systems. Once that project had wrapped up I couldn’t find any other projects on Workflow Foundation which I really enjoy and so I looked for projects in WPF which is also a XAML based WinFX technology. At the time I was looking to specialize in WinFX and continue to try and increase the level of my contributions to the development community around WinFX.<!--more--></p>
<p>For my next project I ended up as an architect for the <em>Street Smart Edge</em> application at Charles Schwab.  <em>Street Smart Edge</em> is a high volume system with around 40000 concurrent users for active traders (day traders) with a high portfolio size requirement.  The application has rich UI needs because these types of traders tend to work on multi monitors that are being feed by real time data. The project was using WPF and this is where I really got to dive in deep. During my time there I evangelized MVVM and was then tasked with refactoring our code base to use MVVM (Model View View Model) pattern. There were a lot of challenges both in evangelizing and implementing this pattern and I ended up compiling a good bit of research on the topic and even had an opportunity to work with Sam Bent who leads WPF’s data services team that invented the binding system that makes MVVM an attractive option. Well this ended up leading to my book deal with Packt and the whole thing has its own momentum now as I have spent my weekends working on the book and talking at whatever conferences and user groups will have me in an effort to evangelize the XAML and MVVM.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your experiences as a Project Lead.</strong></p>
<p>My first lead was at Money Management where I was put in charge of the workflow parts of the call center application for managing clients through credit counseling that we were building. On my next project at Charles Schwab I was hired as a senior programmer in the final year of the three year project.  I came in at a time when there were around 40 contractors from all over the world and 20 full time employees on the project.  It was a really exciting project and I ended up getting promoted to architect with two other full time employees who had 10 years with the company. It was a real honor for me to be singled out in that way. I’m really proud of that and of Street Smart Edge, as it’s a really nice piece of software that really shows off what you can do with WPF. After Charles Schwab I got a contract working on the rewrite of <a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">www</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">.</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">support</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">.</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">dell</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">.</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">com</a> in ASP.NET MVC as a consultant manager. This project was my first time managing an offshore team, also first time on ASP.Net MVC and I got my first taste of working in a really large SOA environment. It was a fun project and learned a lot of valuable skills.</p>
<p>Leading teams is something that I really enjoy and now that I’m at Headspring and working with such talented engineers it’s just a real honor to be trusted with that responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>You have a lot of experience with technical contributions.  How do you choose what to focus on?</strong></p>
<p>I’m a tinker and I’ve always got projects going on things that I find interesting.  Before Workflow, WPF, and Silverlight, it was skateboarding lifestyle projects.  Before skateboarding projects it was computer animation.  I’ve found that for me the formula to do well at things is finding things that I have passion for. As a kid growing up I looked up to professional athletes and thought about how cool it’d be to be a pro and have skills that are respected. Well once you get to an age that you realize that’s not your calling you can still “go pro” and earn some respect in your profession and I really feel that, just like in sports, passion and drive are key to excelling. Fortunately for me, with programming physical skill isn’t a determining factor…</p>
<p><strong>Skateboarding? How did that fit into tinkering projects?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t spend as much time on it anymore, but I used to be heavily involved in Texas skateboarding.  In fact, when I was living in Houston I was really involved with it. People don’t realize it but Texas is really on the map in the skateboard community and I started doing local web zines in Houston to practice my programming but also mix in my other areas of interest. This lead to me and a friend starting a short lived print magazine about skateboarding called “Status”.  We did four issues together and distributed about 20,000 copies throughout the south.  It wasn’t a money maker but it was definitely something that meant a lot to me and we ended up with a team of about 15 or so on the last issue including a full design team.  I ended up learning a lot about graphic design, photography, project management, sales, client relationships and web development during that time.</p>
<p><strong>So what is your biggest accomplishment so far?</strong></p>
<p>Personally, building a happy family with my wife, and professionally, writing my first book.  Learning backside tail slides in my 30s is up there too.</p>
