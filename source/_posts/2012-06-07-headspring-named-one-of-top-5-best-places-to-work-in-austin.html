<p><strong><em></em></strong>Austin, TX – June 07, 2012, Austin-based Headspring, a custom application development and consulting firm, today announced it has been recognized as one of the Austin Business Journal’s “Best Places to Work” in Central Texas.  Headspring ranked number four in the Small Companies category of the 2012 list.</p>
<p>Headspring was chosen as one of the top-five Best Places to Work in Central Texas after a series of voluntary employee surveys which examined climate, team atmosphere, benefits and employee engagement. <img title="More..." src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>“It is such an honor to be named one of the 2012 Best Places to Work in Austin,” says CEO/Founder Dustin Wells. “Austin is a rapidly growing city with an expansive job market; job seekers have a lot of options. We are really touched by the fact our talented team of employees choose to work here and evangelize on behalf of our unique culture.”</p>
<p>Award recipients were announced at a Hollywood-themed luncheon and ceremony on June 6<sup>th</sup> at the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center. The ceremony presentation included pictures and videos submitted by Headspring employees as a testament to their enthusiasm for the award-winning culture and work environment.</p>
<p>This award comes on the heels of Headspring’s announcement earlier this year to hire two new employees per month in 2012 and to promote the existing twenty-five employees within the company. Headspring is experiencing rapid growth and is set to triple the office’s square footage by moving into the Avalon Building, located in northwest Austin, at the end of July.  As Headspring continues to contract new and larger projects, they vow to preserve a fun and collaborative culture, while planning to hire two new employees per month in 2012.</p>
