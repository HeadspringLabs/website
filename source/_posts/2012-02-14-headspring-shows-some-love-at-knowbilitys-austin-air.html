Just in time for Valentine’s Day, three Headspring consultants competed in the annual Austin Accessibility Internet Rally (Austin AIR) hosted by <a href="http://www.knowbility.org/">Knowbility.org</a>.  Knowbility's website explains the goal of the rally is "to teach participating web developers and designers about the tools and techniques necessary to make the web accessible to everyone – including people with disabilities."  In addition, participating nonprofits benefit by receiving professional help to build a new or replace an existing site.  Judging for the competition lasts a couple weeks, and the winner is announced at an awards ceremony in March.

Headspring-ers Anne Epstein, Mahendra Mavani and Deran Schilling showed up bright and early Saturday morning  to form their team, calling themselves the Headspring Hurwitzes (a tribute to our reigning Chief Architect, Kevin Hurwitz). They were assigned to Texas TERA with a mission to breathe life into their stale, outdated website.

Now this is a fine looking group:

The team had a lot of fun and told me how happy they were about having the opportunity to participate.  “It was really a privilege to help out such an important and genuinely interesting and cool organization.  It turned out to be a lot of fun too,” said Anne Epstein.

Deran Schilling, who participated and and won last year’s Houston AIR event told me, “I think the best part was meeting the people that make Texas TERA successful.  They’re an amazing group of people and I was happy that we could help out.  That sounds so canned…but it’s true!”

Mahendra Mavani commented, "First or last, who cares about the winner now? We already won when we showed the happy faces of Texas TERA, who can now use their site on laptops, tablets, and smart phones."
<p align="left">Texas TERA representatives were also happy to be a part of the fun, and thanked their team for providing them with a dramatically improved site. They mentioned the biggest benefit is that now content can easily be edited by anyone on the board or staff, using any device, anywhere.</p>
