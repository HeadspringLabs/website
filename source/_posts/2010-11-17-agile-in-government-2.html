<p>So, let me tell you the reasons why this doesn't work...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a> is actually part<br />
of a project where we're helping to pioneer Agile in government to some degree. One<br />
of the biggest challenges with Agile in government is the procurement vehicles that<br />
government contractors have to follow or use in order to work with a government agency<br />
or an entity in government. Government agencies are used to the traditional PMI approach<br />
to project management and the waterfall methodology. In Texas there is a state mandated<br />
delivery process that all projects over a certain size have to follow which is effectively<br />
a waterfall process wherein everything is defined upfront. The biggest challenge right<br />
now is the procurement vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> An agency wants to write a P.O. for $5,000,000 or $10,000,000<br />
for a project in year one expecting the funds will provide to them everything they<br />
are going to need over the next three years.</p>
<h2>Why is this problematic?<!--more--></h2>
<p>In government particularly, what I've seen is that most of the times stakeholders<br />
dump everything that they originally thought they were going to get for the price<br />
they thought they were going to get it at (i.e. most allotted budget and time is spent<br />
developing features just to reach an admission that the original features, as specified,<br />
were flawed), and so the project goes over budget and the stakeholders settle for<br />
either less than what they paid for or something different as they have learned a<br />
lot along the way. <span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">That<br />
is the biggest challenge right now.</span></p>
<p>If you look at Texas state government contracts through The Department of Information<br />
Resources, there is nothing really in those contracts, besides staff augmentation<br />
contracts, that allows for the variable scope approach of the Agile methodology (or<br />
contracting for capacity). In government, it's institutionalized to think of all projects<br />
similar to, for example, maybe the way a road might be built for a county wherein<br />
there is just:</p>
<ul>
<li>a design</li>
<li>full documentation that can be produced upfront</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, in software there are a lot of reasons why it's very difficult to come<br />
up with years' worth of requirements before beginning development, and despite anyone's<br />
best efforts, we're talking about creating the plans for something with the sophistication<br />
level of perhaps an aircraft carrier. It is not a trivial thing. Getting somebody<br />
within a government agency to actually approve the would-be upfront requirements for<br />
a multiyear project and bet that they are in fact 100% accurate (no changes required)<br />
over such a long period of time is an unfair request of them. The upfront plans simply<br />
aren't 100% accurate in such a scenario.</p>
<p>The kind of people that know what the software needs to do are not the same kinds<br />
of people that can evaluate 5,000 or 10,000 pages of requirements documentation for<br />
accuracy, which is what one is looking at scope-wise for such a long term project<br />
to really fully define things.</p>

<p>Does this well scare you?</p></div>

<p>It scares many in government.</p></div>
</div>
<p>Without that precedent of accepting something in that regard, then what one is left<br />
with is a lot of smaller projects as we discussed before, which could greatly mitigate<br />
risk, but which government agencies are hesitant to sign up for because the procurement<br />
process itself is so onerous. There are so many steps involved that nobody wants to<br />
"go to the well" with regularity. Because it is so difficult to draw up a bucket of<br />
water, government stakeholders would rather just bring everything up at once, but<br />
in doing so they've greatly increased the risk of failure.</p>
<h2>Bleak prognosis. Is there any good news?</h2>
<p>Yes. As a software vendor for a government project, you may have to sign a large contract<br />
to engage with an agency, but ultimately the agency is the arbiter of success or failure<br />
for <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/custom-application-development/" target="_blank">custom<br />
application development</a> and so the stakeholders are not going to be totally inflexible<br />
to what they'll accept and to setting priorities. They can't be. <span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">Executive<br />
involvement though is absolutely key to success.</span></p>
<p>One of the things I've heard before is that large waterfall projects eventually become<br />
Agile as the initial requirements become insufficient to meet needs, and so, essentially<br />
you will get an Agile project eventually with some degree of flexibility in reaching<br />
for requirements. The key to having the eventual shift towards Agile processes go<br />
well is having a good executive sponsorship. Having a good recognition of the transition<br />
to Agile that will appear and the pain that will cause it to manifest is also very<br />
helpful. When the waterfall process starts failing it is best that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>are not surprised</li>
<li>do not consider it a bad thing</li>
<li>don't panic</li>
</ol>
<p>You actually can apply Agile within a more traditional contract.</p>
