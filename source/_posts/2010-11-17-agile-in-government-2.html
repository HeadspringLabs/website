So, let me tell you the reasons why this doesn't work...

<a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a> is actually part
of a project where we're helping to pioneer Agile in government to some degree. One
of the biggest challenges with Agile in government is the procurement vehicles that
government contractors have to follow or use in order to work with a government agency
or an entity in government. Government agencies are used to the traditional PMI approach
to project management and the waterfall methodology. In Texas there is a state mandated
delivery process that all projects over a certain size have to follow which is effectively
a waterfall process wherein everything is defined upfront. The biggest challenge right
now is the procurement vehicles.

<strong>Example:</strong> An agency wants to write a P.O. for $5,000,000 or $10,000,000
for a project in year one expecting the funds will provide to them everything they
are going to need over the next three years.
<h2>Why is this problematic?<!--more--></h2>
In government particularly, what I've seen is that most of the times stakeholders
dump everything that they originally thought they were going to get for the price
they thought they were going to get it at (i.e. most allotted budget and time is spent
developing features just to reach an admission that the original features, as specified,
were flawed), and so the project goes over budget and the stakeholders settle for
either less than what they paid for or something different as they have learned a
lot along the way. <span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">That
is the biggest challenge right now.</span>

If you look at Texas state government contracts through The Department of Information
Resources, there is nothing really in those contracts, besides staff augmentation
contracts, that allows for the variable scope approach of the Agile methodology (or
contracting for capacity). In government, it's institutionalized to think of all projects
similar to, for example, maybe the way a road might be built for a county wherein
there is just:
<ul>
	<li>a design</li>
	<li>full documentation that can be produced upfront</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
In reality, in software there are a lot of reasons why it's very difficult to come
up with years' worth of requirements before beginning development, and despite anyone's
best efforts, we're talking about creating the plans for something with the sophistication
level of perhaps an aircraft carrier. It is not a trivial thing. Getting somebody
within a government agency to actually approve the would-be upfront requirements for
a multiyear project and bet that they are in fact 100% accurate (no changes required)
over such a long period of time is an unfair request of them. The upfront plans simply
aren't 100% accurate in such a scenario.

The kind of people that know what the software needs to do are not the same kinds
of people that can evaluate 5,000 or 10,000 pages of requirements documentation for
accuracy, which is what one is looking at scope-wise for such a long term project
to really fully define things.

Does this well scare you?</div>

It scares many in government.</div>
</div>
Without that precedent of accepting something in that regard, then what one is left
with is a lot of smaller projects as we discussed before, which could greatly mitigate
risk, but which government agencies are hesitant to sign up for because the procurement
process itself is so onerous. There are so many steps involved that nobody wants to
"go to the well" with regularity. Because it is so difficult to draw up a bucket of
water, government stakeholders would rather just bring everything up at once, but
in doing so they've greatly increased the risk of failure.
<h2>Bleak prognosis. Is there any good news?</h2>
Yes. As a software vendor for a government project, you may have to sign a large contract
to engage with an agency, but ultimately the agency is the arbiter of success or failure
for <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/custom-application-development/" target="_blank">custom
application development</a> and so the stakeholders are not going to be totally inflexible
to what they'll accept and to setting priorities. They can't be. <span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: bold;">Executive
involvement though is absolutely key to success.</span>

One of the things I've heard before is that large waterfall projects eventually become
Agile as the initial requirements become insufficient to meet needs, and so, essentially
you will get an Agile project eventually with some degree of flexibility in reaching
for requirements. The key to having the eventual shift towards Agile processes go
well is having a good executive sponsorship. Having a good recognition of the transition
to Agile that will appear and the pain that will cause it to manifest is also very
helpful. When the waterfall process starts failing it is best that you:
<ol>
	<li>are not surprised</li>
	<li>do not consider it a bad thing</li>
	<li>don't panic</li>
</ol>
You actually can apply Agile within a more traditional contract.
