A variable scope project is one where there is guidance as to what the goal is but
the development team is going to figure out the scope along the way.

Now in some sense every project does have variability about it because in a project
of any sufficient size no one can define in sufficient detail all of the information
about the project. A lot of that detail is going to have to be discovered along the
way, and that is pretty well accepted industry knowledge at this point (whereas a
decade ago it was very common to attempt to define all of the details before get started
on any bit of a project).

Today variable scope is widely accepted, and in actuality the trend has probably gone
too much towards the other extreme in favor of defining projects as one goes. You
should beware of a project of completely variable scope where you just go week to
week and decide what to build during the week. Such a project is likely going to fail
in the larger sense, and yet if you attempted to define all the features up front
before you started anything you're likely to fail as well in that extreme too.
<h3>So what is the happy medium?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Define small issue milestones, 6-week to 3-month milestones.</li>
	<li>Make the definition of each milestone very crisp.</li>
	<li>There will be six weeks to three months to bridge before either:
<ol style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
	<li>being able to declare success<!--more--></li>
	<li>being able to see that there's more risk or challenges or work necessary to achieve
a milestone</li>
</ol>
(In the later case, perhaps then you'll scale the milestone back. Alternatively, maybe
you'll achieve the milestone early.)</li>
	<li>It's very important to have a very concrete measure of success, very early and very
frequently, and it is then, with a small definition for success, that variability
of the scope is to your advantage.</li>
</ul>

To software development, one can draw the analogy that just as there is not just one
house that one can construct for a family to protect it from the elements, and that
adequate homes may range in budget from 50 thousand dollars to 50 million dollars,
that it is also true that home constructions have budgets with objectives to work
within. Typically, the budget is fixed and the timeline is somewhat well known.

Software can be equally disparate in the effort required to produce a product that
meets the needs of its users:
<ul>
	<li>You if you need a system that meets certain objectives within six weeks to three months
you could scale the sophistication of the software design to fit the timeline.</li>
	<li>Particularly when you have a fixed budget (and virtually ever organization has some
budget that they need to stay within), then any implementation projects, whether they
be IT or otherwise, can be defined in feature set by their budget.</li>
	<li>In a project, typically the budget is somewhat fixed, the timeline is somewhat well
known, and the objectives are somewhat fixed, but the implementation of those key
objectives in software can vary based on the available of resources. If you understand
this at the beginning of the project you be much better situated to deal with the
challenges of the project.</li>
	<li>Variable scope gives a huge advantage to the client in a software implementation,
giving the stakeholders the ability to change their minds in the middle of a project
if they find an area of higher value for budget allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Headspring example:</h2>
A simple Microsoft Access reporting tool was built for a client, and afterwards, the
client realized that it would be more advantageous to extend the capabilities of the
tool to allow for data entry than it would be to replace an existing data-entry tool
with another solution. The original budget allocated to build a data-entry tool was
reallocated to extend the reporting tool and the client was thrilled with what was
produced.

A variable scope project provides opportunities to change priorities along the way
to really explore objectives that may not have existed upon beginning the project.

On a high level, the three canonical pillars of any kind of project, software or not,
are:
<ol>
	<li>time</li>
	<li>budget</li>
	<li>scope</li>
</ol>
At <a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a> we have found
that most clients needing custom software have an initial budget in mind that is pretty
small in range, but that they need to achieve a specific capability within it, and
so, with the budget fixed, time and scope are left to consider. Often there is something
on the calendar to consider too and so, while the time has a little bit of wiggle
room, it is constrained as well and thus only scope is left undefined. The scope necessarily
needs to be variable in these types of situations.

If you have a budget to spend on a software package, and you can't find a good package
off the shelf, and you've decided you need a custom software package, give us your
requirements. We will either create something that can transport six children and
two adults while calling it a Cadillac Escalade EXT (and offering all of the bells
and whistles of such a product) or we can likewise create a Honda Odyssey Minivan.
Both achieve the goal of transporting people, but they are considerable different
in budget. If a budget is fixed, you need to tailor the situation to the budget.
