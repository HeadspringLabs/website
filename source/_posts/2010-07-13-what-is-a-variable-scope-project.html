<p>A variable scope project is one where there is guidance as to what the goal is but<br />
the development team is going to figure out the scope along the way.</p>

<p>Now in some sense every project does have variability about it because in a project<br />
of any sufficient size no one can define in sufficient detail all of the information<br />
about the project. A lot of that detail is going to have to be discovered along the<br />
way, and that is pretty well accepted industry knowledge at this point (whereas a<br />
decade ago it was very common to attempt to define all of the details before get started<br />
on any bit of a project).</p>
<p>Today variable scope is widely accepted, and in actuality the trend has probably gone<br />
too much towards the other extreme in favor of defining projects as one goes. You<br />
should beware of a project of completely variable scope where you just go week to<br />
week and decide what to build during the week. Such a project is likely going to fail<br />
in the larger sense, and yet if you attempted to define all the features up front<br />
before you started anything you're likely to fail as well in that extreme too.</p>
<h3>So what is the happy medium?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define small issue milestones, 6-week to 3-month milestones.</li>
<li>Make the definition of each milestone very crisp.</li>
<li>There will be six weeks to three months to bridge before either:
<ol style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
<li>being able to declare success<!--more--></li>
<li>being able to see that there's more risk or challenges or work necessary to achieve<br />
a milestone</li>
</ol>
<p>(In the later case, perhaps then you'll scale the milestone back. Alternatively, maybe<br />
you'll achieve the milestone early.)</li>
<li>It's very important to have a very concrete measure of success, very early and very<br />
frequently, and it is then, with a small definition for success, that variability<br />
of the scope is to your advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>To software development, one can draw the analogy that just as there is not just one<br />
house that one can construct for a family to protect it from the elements, and that<br />
adequate homes may range in budget from 50 thousand dollars to 50 million dollars,<br />
that it is also true that home constructions have budgets with objectives to work<br />
within. Typically, the budget is fixed and the timeline is somewhat well known.</p>
<p>Software can be equally disparate in the effort required to produce a product that<br />
meets the needs of its users:</p>
<ul>
<li>You if you need a system that meets certain objectives within six weeks to three months<br />
you could scale the sophistication of the software design to fit the timeline.</li>
<li>Particularly when you have a fixed budget (and virtually ever organization has some<br />
budget that they need to stay within), then any implementation projects, whether they<br />
be IT or otherwise, can be defined in feature set by their budget.</li>
<li>In a project, typically the budget is somewhat fixed, the timeline is somewhat well<br />
known, and the objectives are somewhat fixed, but the implementation of those key<br />
objectives in software can vary based on the available of resources. If you understand<br />
this at the beginning of the project you be much better situated to deal with the<br />
challenges of the project.</li>
<li>Variable scope gives a huge advantage to the client in a software implementation,<br />
giving the stakeholders the ability to change their minds in the middle of a project<br />
if they find an area of higher value for budget allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Headspring example:</h2>
<p>A simple Microsoft Access reporting tool was built for a client, and afterwards, the<br />
client realized that it would be more advantageous to extend the capabilities of the<br />
tool to allow for data entry than it would be to replace an existing data-entry tool<br />
with another solution. The original budget allocated to build a data-entry tool was<br />
reallocated to extend the reporting tool and the client was thrilled with what was<br />
produced.</p>
<p>A variable scope project provides opportunities to change priorities along the way<br />
to really explore objectives that may not have existed upon beginning the project.</p>
<p>On a high level, the three canonical pillars of any kind of project, software or not,<br />
are:</p>
<ol>
<li>time</li>
<li>budget</li>
<li>scope</li>
</ol>
<p>At <a href="http://www.headspring.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a> we have found<br />
that most clients needing custom software have an initial budget in mind that is pretty<br />
small in range, but that they need to achieve a specific capability within it, and<br />
so, with the budget fixed, time and scope are left to consider. Often there is something<br />
on the calendar to consider too and so, while the time has a little bit of wiggle<br />
room, it is constrained as well and thus only scope is left undefined. The scope necessarily<br />
needs to be variable in these types of situations.</p>

<p>If you have a budget to spend on a software package, and you can't find a good package<br />
off the shelf, and you've decided you need a custom software package, give us your<br />
requirements. We will either create something that can transport six children and<br />
two adults while calling it a Cadillac Escalade EXT (and offering all of the bells<br />
and whistles of such a product) or we can likewise create a Honda Odyssey Minivan.<br />
Both achieve the goal of transporting people, but they are considerable different<br />
in budget. If a budget is fixed, you need to tailor the situation to the budget.</p>
