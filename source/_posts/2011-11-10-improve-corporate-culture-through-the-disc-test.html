A variety of personalities exist in the workplace and being able to collaborate with teammates efficiently is important for a company’s success. While routines and personalities become clearer the longer employees work together, it’s also helpful to know and understand the behavioral styles of other employees and learn how to adapt to them. The DiSC Assessment is a personality test that focuses on behavioral and personality situations and is an effective tool and guideline for the workplace to use. <!--more-->

The results are productive for yourself to assess where you are, where you want to be and how you can better communicate with others, especially your teammates and customers. The assessment is also productive for your teammates because they learn your how to best work and communicate with you.

At Headspring, we have employees take the DiSC test when they first join the team and we use the results in our day-to-day interactions. It not only improves our team dynamic, but it helps us understand each other and our thought processes.

After a short questionnaire, the assessment groups you into one of four groups:

<strong>Dominance</strong> (D) – Individuals in this group focus on control and like getting immediate results. These individuals are also direct, fast-paced, driven and strong-willed.

<strong>Influence</strong> (I) – Individuals in this group focus on social situations. They are motivated by social recognition and being influential to others. These individuals are enthusiastic, optimistic, convincing and trusting.

<strong>Steadiness</strong> (S) – Individuals in this group focus on structure. They are motivated by opportunities to help and stability. These individuals are patient, calm, stable and consistent.

<strong>Compliance</strong> (C) – Individuals in this group focus on accuracy. They are driven by quality work and knowledge. These individuals are careful, tactful, systematic, and cautious.

Although we all have each of the four groups in us, there is usually one dominate group in each person that has a bigger presence in the way we act. While the DiSC assessment is not the end all of having the most efficient office, it’s a good reference and starting point in improving the work relationships and team building. Curious about your results and want to learn how this assessment can improve your corporate culture?
