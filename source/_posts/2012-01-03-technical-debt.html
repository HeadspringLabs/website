<p>In a perfect world, you build a product that runs smoothly and effortlessly forever.  It is instantly popular, and is built in such a way that it provides a uniform experience no matter whom or how many gravitate towards it.  Users love it just the way it is, and are pleasantly surprised by each new feature or version. Nothing goes wrong, so this product does not require support staff or maintenance of any kind.  You hire a few developers to add new features here and there, and these employees are completely content to stay in one position at your company forever and ever amen.</p>
<p>However, this is not a perfect world.  Your users are real people, all with varying skill levels, intellect, hardware, expectations, moods, etc.  Same goes for the staff you hire to support the product and develop new features.  Ahh… the human factor.</p>
<p>And then maybe you experience an error or two. Maybe the server shuts down. Maybe your new versions aren’t always compatible. If you’re really lucky, maybe you get hacked. Oh joy!</p>
<p>So, you code.  You code something that will fix the problem.  You code something to patch over what you are dealing with so you don’t have to deal with it again.  Each time you duct tape over a problem with code, it’s as if you have charged the problem to your technical credit card.</p>
<p>The correlation between technical complexity and debt was first proposed by<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham"> </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">Ward Cunningham</a> in 1992.  Basically, technical debt is the result of trying to fix problems too quickly, without regard for long term consequences.  In my opinion, this nasty cycle stems from our culture of instant gratification.  Software organizations want to fix problems quickly because they don’t want to lose impatient end users. “Fix it; I don’t care how.”</p>
<p>User experience is your most important priority; you don’t want to tinker around with too many questions while the server is down.  However, keep in mind that quick fixes accrue interest.  Piecing a whole system together with quick remedies as you go along is a lot like only paying the minimum payment on your balance. Sometimes, a little bit of debt is okay, as long as you are willing to pay the monthly balance back in full. What I mean by that is you will need to look at the problem in terms of the big picture eventually.</p>
<p>You have to be willing to roll your sleeves up and pull out the engine at some point.  The root of the problem is in there somewhere.  Take a little bit time up front.  When you can, pay for solutions with cash instead of credit.  This means investing your <em>time</em> in looking at how the problem affects the whole system.</p>
<p>How does your organization highlight technical debt so you can go back and deal with it?</p>
