<p>There are a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>One of the principle tenets in business in general is that a business should focus on its core competency and outsource everything else. And so, for a services company, for example that does property management, where software development is not their core competency, there may not necessarily be package solutions available in the market for them to run their business, so that is where another company could help meet a need, essentially creating the software that differentiates a services company. The services company doesn't need to build a competency around software development, and, in particular, doesn't even need the ongoing capacity of having an entire development team once a particular internal application is put into play.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>When you talk about services businesses partnering, a couple things should come to mind.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>One is outsourcing anything that's not your core competency, so that could range from accounting, to finance, to HR (that's a common one), to, another one that a lot of our clients share, software. The clients of Headspring outsource either their entire software development to us or part of their IT and infrastructure management. It does go back to focusing on what you're good at and you're core competency, what you're delivering. Outsourcing, other areas, whether it's HR or a technology strategy or a technology implementation allows the best of breed companies to come in and bring you up to speed in the given area of your business. That way you can focus on your core business, which is delivering your actual service to clients.</li>
<li>Typically we'll see, innovators in their field, whatever their service industries may be, that are really "bought in" to the outsourcing model. They're growing really quickly. They're growing too fast to worry about how to build an HR department, or how to build a software development team, or how to build an IT infrastructure, or an infrastructure team, or a technology team. And so, we see innovators that are really looking hard at the outsourcing model or are already implementing it. We also see that the innovators who are staying ahead are the ones that are technologically ahead of their competitors, holding a better advantage technology-wise. This could be anything, from software to other technology-related solutions. If we were to become a partner with a services business we'd want to look at not only software opportunities but also other areas where the potential partner may get that competitive advantage.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What are some pitfalls to be wary of when searching for a partner?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The kind of relationship that often doesn't lead to success is one which is simply defined by a time-and-materials-based contract, in which success for the contracting company or special services company is based on expending hours while success for their client is based on something very different. This is something that Headspring tries to avoid in the way it sets up projects. The biggest thing you'll want in the partnership is a mutual best interest in the arrangement. What we've found is our best partnerships with our clients tend to come when we have a common stake in the successful outcome of a project. There are a lot of ways to structure an agreement or a relationship between two companies to that end.</li>
<li>A lack of alignment: We want to be in lockstep with a client and be in alignment with what their goals are. A lot of times, companies call partners like us, when they've got problem X, or goal X, and they think that Y will fix it. They call a company like ours to build Y. What happens a lot of times is Y actually doesn't fix X or reach the goals. Y doesn't get a client there fully, landing the client in a place where they've spent a lot of money and they've partially missed some of their goals, or they haven't fixed their problem(s) at all. We like to get involved earlier in the process where clients can bring us in strategically and say: "Here's our goals. Here's what we're trying to do." Then we'll decide if building Y makes sense or if it is better to build part of Y and then building something else as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's just about trying to be in lockstep and in good alignment with the client and the client's goals rather than being accountable for building a set of functionality that performs certain tasks.</p>
<p>There's actually a lot to be wary of when hiring a company to do custom software development for you, because there's really unfortunately a lot of things that can go wrong. Be wary of a company without experience mitigating risks on a custom software development project or of a company that's just simply not accustomed to having to develop a sophisticated piece of software and maintain it over a long period of time.</p>
<p>One of the easy ways to spot technical excellence is by asking about the way a company would automate testing of the software produced. If a company doesn't feel comfortable or doesn't seem to have experience there are a lot of times that's a good key indicator, and one you quickly arrive at, to determine that they may not be capable of managing a piece of software for a long time, successfully.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-418" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="transparency" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/transparency-300x199.gif" alt="" width="300" height="199" />Transparency<br />
</strong>Be leery of a lack of transparency. If a company doesn't want to be transparent and is not showing you what it is working on every week, it is not really showing you under the covers and what's going on. That's something to be wary of. We try to operate in complete transparency so everyone knows what's going on every step of the way, so that we can change directions if we need to. The transparency side is really important in having a good partnership, and that's more open communication more than anything else, so if someone is opposed to that then that would be a roadblock for me.</p>
