Headspring’s hands-on boot camps give participants the chance to take what they are learning and apply it in an existing application. Students will walk away from this course with working examples of how to get the most out of HTML5.

<strong>Why Learn HTML5</strong>

More and more, the development of business applications is shifting away from server-side due to the superior user experience and ease of coding that front-end development produces. Not only are managers expecting the use of these new technologies, but end users also want the same experience they get from using personal tools and software with those they interact with at work.
