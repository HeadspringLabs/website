<p>Outside of one six-month period at my last job, I’ve always shared an office with my boss.  It’s not easy.  In fact, it’s not really that easy to share work space with anyone.  Obviously noise is an issue – noisy talking, breathing, typing, eating etc.  With a boss, noise is even more difficult to cope with because usually your preferences come second to theirs.  Also, sharing work space with a boss grays boundaries of the appropriate use of time and conversation.  You have to be on time (all the time), constantly focused, and prepared to smile politely <em>for every interruption.</em>  Furthermore, the two of you are much more exposed to each other’s shortcomings than anyone would prefer. Your boss is there to micro-manage every conversation or task, and you are there to witness every breakdown or breach of authority.</p>
<p>Here are some important facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your boss wants personal space too</li>
<li>You’re probably not going to get it</li>
</ol>
<p>So…<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>If you can’t communicate well with your boss, these problems will always be problems.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, there is a greater, systematic reason why open and honest communication never happens at a company.  But most of the time it’s definitely possible to alleviate the pressure by simply talking to your boss about what you’re dealing with. Bosses aren’t evil; they really do want you to be as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>One way to breakdown the communication barrier is to ask more questions. Being considerate of your boss’s situation is the first step, and don’t expect have to have all the answers right up front.  Instead of pointing the finger by listing your complaints, try to ask questions like, “How can I make this more comfortable for you?” or “I have some ideas about how to make the room quieter; can we talk?” or “You usually have great advice for me, so is it ok if we talk things through a little more before deciding on a solution?”</p>
<p>Once you are able to talk openly about any problem, it makes it a lot easier to tackle other problems together.</p>
<p>For the record: I really like sharing an office with my boss, Katie. Because we share space, we have a much more casual and relaxed relationship.  If I’m struggling with something, I’m able to talk it through with her before giving up. If we were in a separate space, I don’t think I would be as willing to admit failures or shortcomings without “explaining them away.”  We have discussed this scenario before, and labeled it the “no room for error relationship.”  Because she is here, she understands the context of my day, and can help me accomplish my own goals. Conversely, she doesn’t have to be brilliant all by herself.  I’m here to bounce ideas around, brainstorm, or remind her of details in my work that could positively or negatively affect her strategy and decision making.  She's smart, not perfect, and it helps that she knows it.</p>
<p>What are some other pros/cons of sharing space with a boss, and how do you cope?</p>
