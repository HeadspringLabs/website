<p>If it can't be drawn, it can't be built. It’s the mantra in our office. Having heard it almost every day that I have been here at Headspring, I never really understood its power before I set out on the (thought to be exciting) task of rebuilding the company website.</p>
<p>I knew I’d have to gather requirements for the site. Having no idea of what requirement gathering techniques were out there I just started a word document list: pages, forms, content.  When I sat down with the team to start developing the site, they needed more information about site flow.<!--more--></p>
<p>I tried explaining with my 17 page word document, highlighted and notes scribbled on the side, but no one was getting it (including myself). When one brilliant person suggested that we draw it out, markers opened and the drawing began: home page, top-nav pages, children pages, forms and so on.</p>
<p>When we were done the picture finally became clear. All my requirements, even those that I had forgotten about, were there and easy to follow. No matter what you’re building, please learn from my mistake and start off drawing your requirements, because if it can’t be drawn, it can’t be built.</p>
