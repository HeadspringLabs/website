<h2>Headspring is a Principal Sponsor of Monospace</h2>
<strong>Austin, Texas</strong> - Continuing its involvement in open source for the .NET Framework, Headspring has become a principal sponsor of the Monospace Conference running from October 27 to October 30 in Austin.

Dustin Wells, Headspring's CEO, comments "Headspring is very excited about the future of Mono and the possibilities it opens for utilizing the .NET Framework on iPhones, other Macintoshes, and Linux."

The conference is to teach .NET software developers and organizations how to use the Mono framework and Microsoft .NET to leverage existing investments in skills and applications on a broader array of platforms for a broader array of opportunities. Tutorials at Monospace are to be on, amongst other topics, cross-platform development, MonoTouch, how to use NHibernate in tandem with Mono and .NET, and Moonlight (Mono's implementation of Silverlight).

A commitment to open source for .NET is a core principal of Headspring. In addition to sponsoring Monospace, Headspring's employees have contributed to numerous .NET open source projects including, MvcContrib, AutoMapper, The Tarantino Project, and CodeCampServer. Jeffrey Palermo, Headspring's CTO, comments "We leverage open source software when delivering software projects. The more we support the open source community, the more we benefit."
