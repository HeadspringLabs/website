<strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong>

I have more than 15 years of application development experience. In that time, I’ve seen the evolution of the Web. By understanding where technology originated, it helps provide a clearer picture of where it may go.  The uncertainty of how competing priorities have shaped the software applications that are currently available makes it an exciting time to be at Headspring to contribute to the needs of its customers.

I became passionate about Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) because I understood the pain it was trying to alleviate for companies.  Bidirectional communication using binary serialization over TCP that can be easily transitioned to other transportation protocols like HTTP really caught my interest.  WCF has had to keep pace with the industry due to emerging technologies such as Ajax using JSON serialization instead of SOAP. Its use in the background will remain intact while abstractions are built on top of it to facilitate new applications.       <!--more-->

<strong>Who are your ideal clients to work for?</strong>

The best part of software development is that it has allowed me to work across a wide range of companies. If software can help solve a business problem, we want to work with a company to do it. Then the only other factor is the willingness of the company to come together to work with developers and rely on their expertise to find a technical solution.

<strong>What led you to software development?</strong>

I was led to software by the idea that I could get paid to put together puzzles.  Software allows you to use your imagination to visualize a concept and then bring that concept into something others can see and interact with.  When a day goes by without noticing it, you know the career you have chosen is the right one.

<strong>What did you learn first?</strong>

Besides my introduction to software in elementary school using “Turtle Graphics”, I learned Visual Basic 4 along with Relational Databases coming out of college and started my first “real” job.

<strong>Do you like teaching?</strong>

Yes, I like teaching very much.  I owe my own career to friends and colleagues that took the time to show me how to learn the various technologies.  I enjoy the different ways people learn similar concepts.  Having to adapt to different learning styles makes the teacher’s own understanding greater.  As a result, everyone comes out ahead.

<strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong>

I ask myself whether I’ve added to my understanding of something new, or did I complete a defined objective?  Time wasted is usually a result of a lack of clear objectives, or misunderstanding a concept foundational to a new technology.
