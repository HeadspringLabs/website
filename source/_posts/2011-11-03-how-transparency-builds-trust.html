<strong>Do you really want to know how the sausage is made?</strong>

It’s all a matter of perspective. We allow our customers to peek behind the curtain as much as they like, but not all of them want to be involved in the minutae. Want to have a daily check-in call with your team lead? Sure thing. Want to find know what tools we use to automate our regression testing? Maybe, maybe not.

If I’m in the market for 100 lbs of Boudin, the merchant should probably find out why I’m buying it in order to help uncover which parts of the process I would care about. They’d probably ask a lot of questions.  Are you reselling it? Do you have any allergies? How drunk are your guests going to be? Do you want to see the slaughter-room? Why not? Where are you going?<!--more-->

We’re as transparent as our customers need, it’s not a one-size fits all. That being said, there is a minimum. We don’t want a check from you only to have you disappear until the final product is done. With our iterative development process, we need feedback from our customers as we introduce our solution gradually. We don’t want to cook up a couple of hundred pots of jambalaya only for you to tell us that you don’t like okra. Iterative releases are like the sample cups.

<strong>Tour the facility, put on a hairnet, grab that cleaver.</strong>

We’ve all heard of a vendor that has prestigious mailing addresses on Madison Avenue, K Street, or Rodeo Drive. Meanwhile the work is being done out of a Starbucks. Not necessarily the type of people to bet the ranch on. However, if they’re upfront with how their business is done, talent can overcome infrastructure.

What people are really concerned about is knowing that your company uses ethical business practices and isn’t tricking them into false beliefs. We provide this transparency to our customers by having weekly face to face meetings to review hours spent on their projects and what value they will see from those hours spent.

Business transparency is a strong business practice that helps strengthen a company, strengthen the relationships between the company and its clients. How can your company be more transparent?
