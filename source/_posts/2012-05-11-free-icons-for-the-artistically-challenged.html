I freely admit it – I have very little talent for creating images. So when I recently needed to add an icon to a website for users to download files, I dreaded the thought of having to create a picture of a download arrow.  Then I remembered that Visual Studio comes with images that can be freely used in your applications!

The image library is installed with Visual Studio, but you’ll have to extract the contents yourself.  Look in C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0Common7VS2010ImageLibrary1033 (or just “Program Files” if you still have a 32bit machine) and you’ll find VS2010ImageLibrary.zip.

Extract this to some place convenient and you’ll find a variety of available images. Most of them are related to Office or Windows, but there are some good general purpose icons in there too. Be sure to check the ReadMe for terms of use (in essence, use the image in its intended manner, a save button shouldn’t delete data). The exact license is discussed <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/629031/visual-studio-image-library-license" target="_blank">here</a>.

Here’s a small sample of some of the images available in the library.
