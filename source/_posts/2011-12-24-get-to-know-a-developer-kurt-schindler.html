<p>For a long time, Kurt Schindler liked the process of creating software much more than coding it.  However, because of his desire to create better systems and process, he needed to continue learning and growing as a developer.</p>
<p>He had been working on an ASP.NET platform since version 1.1, and when ASP.NET MVC came out, he was immediately interested.  He learned more and more, and began to really enjoy the process of software architecture.  He became an active participant on Stack Overflow, and today still ranks in the 10% of users who have answered questions on the subject of ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>After spending a few years at his first post-college job in a small town in Florida, he decided to move to New York City and test out his expertise in a larger community.  He lived there for three and half years, working his way up at a law firm. Eventually Kurt met his wife and they decided it was time to change the scenery a bit.  They wanted a little more relaxation than New York could provide, but still wanted to live in a vibrant city.</p>
<p>He and his wife had traveled to Austin several times, and enjoyed its uniquely friendly features – regarding both lifestyle and scenery.  He knew he wanted to work in a smaller, more creative environment, and Austin’s booming tech industry provided him plenty of opportunity. He found Headspring and immediately fit right in.</p>
<p>As a senior consultant, Kurt focuses on consistency and risk mitigation.  He doesn’t like over engineered software, and values simple, solution-based systems.  In his free time, Kurt can be found reading anything from the Management &amp; Leadership section of the bookstore. His favorite book is <em>Think and Grow Rich </em>by Napoleon Hill.  “This and some of Hill’s works are my go-to’s for inspiration. This particular book reminds me that what the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”</p>
<p>Kurt explained to me that he sticks to a strict, non-fiction only reading diet. He reads to learn, rather than for entertainment. To share his knowledge he continues to participate with online and offline communities, and occasionally blogs (link).</p>
<p>These days he is interested in seeing how HTML5 and the mobile device market plays out. “We’ve got iOS, several Android platforms, and Windows 8 around the corner.  All of them offer a similar end-user experience, but developing software for them is very different. <strong>Will HTML5 end up pushing most apps to the browser, or will people continue to build native apps that have thus far dominated the marketplace?”</strong></p>
