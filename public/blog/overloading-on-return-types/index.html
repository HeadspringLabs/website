	<h2 class="title">Overloading on Return Types</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>When you define two methods with the same name in C#, they have to take in different argument types in order for them to be distinguished from each other.  Sometimes, I find myself wishing that you could also overload a method name when the inputs are the same, but return types differ.</p>
<p>Technically, you can&#8217;t do that in C#, but you can fake it.</p>
<h2>What would that even <em>mean</em>?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine a hypothetical C# in which you were allowed to overload on return types.  Consider the following class:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891704.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In the call to <code>foo.GetValue()</code>, we cannot tell which method should be called.  However, what if we tried to call it with some more context?</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891706.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>When we have some local type information available, we really could make an unambiguous decision about which overload to call.  When initializing <code>i</code>, the only overload that could work is the one returning an <code>int</code>.  When initializing <code>b</code>, the only overload that could work is the one returning a <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>We could conceivably find the right overload to call <em>based on how the return value is used</em>.  That seems odd at first, but there&#8217;s nothing really Earth-shattering about it.  Even in today&#8217;s real C#, overloads are picked based on what call-site types we happen to be using, and this would simply be yet another bit of call-site type information at our disposal.  Also, today&#8217;s real C# figures out the type of a lambda expression based on how it&#8217;s <em>used</em> as well, so there&#8217;s a precedent for being able to use usage-site context.</p>
<h2>Using &#8216;out&#8217; Parameters</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s rewrite the original invalid class, using &#8216;out&#8217; parameters instead of return types:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891722.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This is completely valid.  <strong>When picking the right overload to call, the compiler considers &#8216;out&#8217; parameters as if they were inputs.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  There is no substantive difference between a method that returns some type <code>T</code>, and a <code>void</code> method with an &#8216;out&#8217; parameter of type <code>T</code>.  The difference is only skin deep.
</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Concrete Example</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve encountered this in the real world on a few projects, dealing with the unfortunate interface <code>IDataReader</code>.  This is the interface used to process low-level ADO.NET result sets one row at a time.  Nowadays, most of us access databases with higher-level tools like NHibernate or PetaPoco, but this interface serves as a good example because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) It was written before .NET gained generics, so it has some awkwardly-named methods we&#8217;d like to work around.<br />
  2) Using it leads you to write hard-to-read, monotonous code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these issues will be resolved with the &#8216;out&#8217; keyword.</p>
<p>This interface exposes many methods that take in an <code>int</code> and return a value.  The input <code>int</code> indicates which column of the result set you are interested in, and the method <em>name</em> says what type you hope to find in that column.  <code>reader.GetInt32(2)</code> gives you the <code>int</code> found in the third column, <code>reader.GetDataTime(3)</code> gives you the <code>DateTime</code> found in the fourth column, etc.  To further complicate matters, you shouldn&#8217;t call these methods when the result set contains the special <code>DBNull</code> value.  When using this interface, you end up writing ugly things like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891743.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Note that every time you want call one of these Get* methods, you answer two questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) What type do I expect to find at the given position?<br />
  2) Are null values possible at the given position?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note also that in each line, both of these questions are answered by the declared type of the left-hand-side.  Why should we have to repeat those answers on the right-hand-side?  Armed with some extension methods and the &#8216;out&#8217; keyword, things get much less repetative:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891749.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re reading in 10 or so columns, the brevity adds up.  When writing a method that needs to read in a record from an <code>IDataReader</code>, you are <em>thinking</em> &#8220;I expect to get back values with these names, at these positions, with these types&#8221;.  You are <em>not</em> thinking &#8220;I expect to pull a Guid out of the first position so I&#8217;ll GetGuid, and I expect to pull an int out of the second position so I&#8217;ll GetInt32 but watch out for DBNull, and&#8230;&#8221;.  By &#8220;overloading on the return type&#8221;, we get to say what we mean <em>and nothing else</em>.</p>
<p>I rarely use &#8216;out&#8217; parameters, but it&#8217;s nice to know they actually have a purpose every now and again, when the need presents itself.</p>
