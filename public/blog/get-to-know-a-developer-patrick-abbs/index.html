	<h2 class="title">Get to Know a Developer: Patrick Abbs</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6318" title="Patrick Abbs" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/photo-1-e1357685470139-224x300.jpg" alt="Patrick Abbs" width="224" height="300" />This week we welcomed in a New Year and a new consultant to the team: Patrick Abbs.  Patrick is a native Austinite, but just moved back from New York.  He went to NYU for Individualized Study – a new type of customized undergraduate degree program. He explained to me that he chose a focus of study (Game Theory) and developed his own course schedule around it. He had to produce a senior thesis and submit it before a board, similar to the process of obtaining a graduate degree.</p>
<p>In school and in the workforce, he found programming knowledge to be very helpful in crunching data for statistical analysis. Eventually, he was led to Headspring. Read more about how that happened:</p>
<p><strong>Where did you work, and what did you do before coming to Headspring?</strong></p>
<p>My last two jobs were completely different from each other, but Headspring is interestingly kind of a mix between the two.  At the tech startup Tilde, I worked with the LAMP stack (as well as some C# and Python) to create a B-to-B tool for businesses to streamline their back-office processes.  At DRSdigital, I worked directly with new and existing clients to create, customize, and maintain secure data rooms (typically for potential merger and acquisition deals).</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I have worked extensively with algorithms geared towards statistical analysis of information sets, and am especially well-acquainted with mixture models (a more specific type of statistical algorithm).  As much as I love statistics algorithms, though, I definitely want to expand my expertise into other areas of programming.  At the moment I&#8217;m fascinated with the differences between and advantages of different types of databases, as well as with how compilers work.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>The initial appeal of software development for me came from the recognition that once a program has been written to solve a given type of problem once, it can thereafter solve any instance of that problem an endless number of times with incredible efficiency and little effort.  For instance, it might take me two minutes to sort fifty documents according to some ordering criteria manually, versus ten minutes to write a program which executes the same sorting methodology.  However, after I have written such a program I can use it to sort any number of documents any number of times in a matter of milliseconds for each execution, all with the click of a button.  Once I started thinking about software development as something that requires some initial time investment but can save exponentially more time in the long run, I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>My first introduction to code was as a mathematically-oriented person trying to convey algorithms to software developers for implementation.  The fact that I had no experience with code and the developers I was working with had a limited understanding of math significantly slowed the rate at which theory could be converted to practice, so I decided to try to bridge the gap between our areas of understanding by learning the relatively simple, mathematical language Python.</p>
<p><strong>What or who made you want to work here?</strong></p>
<p>Headspring is an appealing place to work for me for several reasons.  It is known for having a great and open company culture (which I saw first-hand at the two lunch-and-learns I&#8217;ve attended).  I&#8217;m also excited about the fact that the vast majority of the people working there are seasoned, experienced professionals, and as a less experienced developer I really value being able to ask questions and learn from the experience of the people around me.</p>
<p>As far as the actual responsibilities of being a Headspring consultant, I really like the fact that the projects are diverse and let me work on a variety of different programming challenges.  Finally, I like the fact that working at Headspring often involves working directly with clients.  I love technology, but regularly interacting with clients is exciting to me.</p>
