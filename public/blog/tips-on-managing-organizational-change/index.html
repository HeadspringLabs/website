	<h2 class="title">Tips on Managing Organizational Change</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Growing and evolving companies encounter many changes over time. Shifts in leadership, policies, new structures, targets, acquisitions, disposals, re-locations, etc., all create new systems and environments and are just a few of the organizational changes a business can go through. Although these changes might be implemented for continued growth and success, change is typically hard to deal with - especially if your team is already incredibly busy.  Resistance will probably occur – it might even occur from the person or management team who initiated the organizational changes in the first place. Remember, change of any kind is typically met with resistance. However, for a company to reach the next level or continue on the road to success, change is usually inevitable. How does a company endure and manage organizational change to keep the company from falling apart? In order to minimize difficulties, we think the key is communication. Communicate. Communicate. And then communicate some more. This will help ensure your team will not only understand, but also want to be part of the <a title="Reasons Why People Break Up…With Their Company" href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/10/reasons-why-people-break-upwith-their-company" target="_blank">big painted picture</a>.</p>
<p>Any type of organizational change needs to be explained to your entire team as clearly as possible. This might also take some follow up communication for weeks or even months after the new changes are proposed and implemented – think meetings, memos, one-on-one meetings, etc. to ensure everyone is grasping the big picture. This will also ensure your teams involvement in validating and/or refining the changes. Part of open communication means being open to listening to your team’s input. When explaining or presenting new organizational changes, avoid expressions like <em>mindset change, changing people&#8217;s mindsets </em>or<em> changing attitudes</em>. This language often indicates an imposed or enforced change, and it strongly suggests the company believes its team currently has the <em>wrong </em>mindset, which is never want you want to portray and it’s never the case. If people are not approaching their tasks or the organization effectively, then the organization has the wrong mindset, not the people.</p>
<p>How your managers communicate and participate is crucial to the change process. I repeat. How your managers communicate and participates is crucial to the change process. Your management team should enable and facilitate through communication and leadership, not just convey and implement policy from above, which does not work. You cannot impose change. Your teams need to be empowered to find their own solutions and responses, with facilitation and support from the managers. Open and frequent communication is the best way to make sure this happens. There also needs to be tolerance and compassion from the leaders and executives. This will help your team trust the organization and employees need to be able to trust the organization.</p>
<p>Following these tips will ensure any company going through organizational change can do it with success. Although there will be some challenges, open, frequent and effective communication can make this transition a lot smoother.</p>
