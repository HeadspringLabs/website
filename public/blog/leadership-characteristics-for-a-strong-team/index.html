	<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/?attachment_id=3488" rel="attachment wp-att-3488"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3488" title="Leader and his team" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/leadership-characteristics.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="346" /></a>From championship-winning sports teams to multi-million dollar companies, strong, cohesive and successful teams take a great amount of hard work, dedication and focus. While many successful teams and organizations credit the strength of the team effort as the reason for their success, there is no doubt great leaders also have a big impact and are a big part of the foundation for a strong team. Think about how Vince Lombardi’s coaching in the NFL or Walt Disney’s inspiration in the entertainment industry left impacting legacies and provided great guidance to their teams. Without leaders like Lombardi and Disney, the success of the Green Bay Packers and the Disney franchise would be different in the history books. Behind great companies, organizations, and teams are instrumental individuals with key leadership characteristics who can propel the results from good to great.</p>
<p>Great leaders take on a mission or goal of an organization or as entrepreneurs do, they develop one of their own. They live the mission, which many times comes from their passion of doing what they love. Clear illustrations are athletes who love the game and encourage their teammates by example on the field. Another example is Steve Jobs and his love of improving technology for people. Their passion bleeds into their actions and inevitably shows in the results.</p>
<p>Great leaders then strategize the best ways to reach their goal and guide their team on the route, which may even involve shifting the route when obstacles arise, new teammates are recruited or unavoidable circumstances come their way. Great leaders not only adapt to change but they excel through it. The risks they take may not always have the best outcomes, but they learn from their experiences to make better choices in the future.</p>
<p>Although many may argue that great leaders are born, there are clear examples in history and even at Headspring, that great leaders can be made. With changing needs in the environment, such as new problems that need solutions, a leader can be made when he/she encounters circumstances. In those situations, self-made or environment-made, a great leader excels when he/she is able to take his/her focus on the goal and guide the rest of the team to achieve the goal. Great leaders stay engaged with their team and encourage and challenge them along the way. It’s important for leaders to stay focused, accept and adapt to change when necessary and support their team the best they can.</p>
<p>Do you know any great leaders? What do you admire most about him/her?</p>
