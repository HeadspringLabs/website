	<h2 class="title">Headspring Reports Year-End Results and Projections for 2013</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><h2 style="text-align: left;" align="center"><i>67 percent growth in sales generates launch of mobile software brand and new Texas location</i></h2>
<p><b>AUSTIN, TX – (January 29, 2013) – </b>Headspring, a leading custom software development company, today announced a 67 percent growth in revenue. Headspring grew 50 percent year over year for the past two years and in 2012 exceeded its unprecedented growth cycle.</p>
<p>The company increased its client base, as well as the size and scope of its software development and consulting projects. Among Headspring’s 76 clients are government agencies, retail chains, e-commerce firms, and software vendors.  Headspring&#8217;s clients include both Fortune 500 companies and mid-market firms based in Austin, Dallas, and Houston, Texas.</p>
<p>“From day one, we focused on building a team that is creative and dedicated to top-notch results for our clients,” said Dustin Wells, CEO, Headspring. “But our success is about more than just the bottom-line, it’s about company culture.  If culture isn’t measured as a business priority, a company will lose ground quickly.”</p>
<p>To help manage its rapid growth, in June 2012, Headspring nearly tripled its office space and moved into an 11,319-square-foot headquarters building. In addition, Headspring hired 12 new employees, growing the team to 35, and promoted 17 employees.  Last year, Headspring ranked 4<sup>th</sup> of the “Best Places to Work in Central Texas” by <i>Austin Business Journal</i>, placed in the “Top 100 Best Companies to Work for in Texas” by <i>Texas Monthly</i>, and made national honors on the list of “101 Best and Brightest Companies to Work For.”</p>
<p>In 2013, Headspring forecasts continued growth and job expansion.  The company will increase the number of employees by adding 24 overall positions.  Headspring Houston will open in May, adding up to 10 team members at that location by the end of the year.  Expansion into the Houston market reflects the growing software needs of companies. One of the biggest challenges facing the industry is the need for more qualified and talented software developers.</p>
<p>“Opening an office in Houston will give Headspring the ability to attract from a broader pool of developers and also serve the increasing needs of the Houston business market,” said Glenn Burnside, vice president of engineering, Headspring.</p>
<p>In April, Headspring will launch Headspring Mobile, an independent brand focused strictly on delivering mobile application solutions. Headspring has developed a number of mobile applications under its Headspring brand, such as <a href="http://bit.ly/Vs4Tya">1<sup>st</sup> Down Technologies</a>. According to a recent report by research firm Strategy Analytics, more than 200 million mobile workers will be using mobile business applications in 2013.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about Headspring Mobile,” Wells said. “Headspring is plugged into what our customers are saying they need, and with the tremendous growth of the mobile industry, it makes sense to make this part of our product solutions.”</p>
