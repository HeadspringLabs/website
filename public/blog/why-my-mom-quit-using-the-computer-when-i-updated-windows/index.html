	<h2 class="title">Why My Mom Quit Using the Computer When I Updated Windows</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Are you on the verge of a mutiny?</p>
<p>For my Mom&#8217;s birthday I decided it would be nice if I bought her a computer. (Moms are funny; she had purchased three PCs for my brother and me before we were out of the house, but she never had the desire to learn to use one herself.)</p>
<p>We went out to the electronics store one day to pick out the one that she wanted. Her two biggest requirements were that she needed to access washingtonpost.com, and she wanted to learn to play Scrabble online. We ended up picking out a pretty generic machine with a decent amount of memory and some antivirus software for all of the &#8220;free iPod&#8221; ads I was sure she would click on.</p>
<p>This was six years ago, and she was happy as she could be. I was too, albeit completely unprepared for how good she would get at Scrabble. Then I had to go and screw it all up.</p>
<p>I stopped by the house a couple of months ago and brought with me a copy of Windows 7. I figured she hadn&#8217;t upgraded in six years, and she&#8217;d be cool with me installing it. Not the case. After I left I got a phone call from a very angry Mom. She sounded like I did after I installed Vista.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t find my pictures. I wanted to put my pictures from New Zealand on Facebook.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Everything&#8217;s different.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Can you come over and change it back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking back, it was a sneaky move on my part. I should have asked before I acted, but I thought I was doing her a favor. As a more technically experienced person, I was projecting my own values on to her. I knew Windows 7 was better than her seven year-old XP, but I didn&#8217;t stop to think if she would think so too.</p>
<p>A lot of times people ask me about the best way to transition their employees to a new piece of software. I always ask them, &#8220;Why do you want to change? Does your team also see a problem?&#8221; Of course you shouldn&#8217;t make your decision on whether to change software based solely on what your employees think about the current system. However, it&#8217;s important to anticipate the feedback from the people who will be learning the new product as well as those who will be measuring its success. Do they see the reason for the change? What is your plan to train them on the new technology? How much user error can you absorb after the change is made? Getting them invested in the reasons for the switch as well as the plan for transition is the key to avoiding a mutiny.</p>
