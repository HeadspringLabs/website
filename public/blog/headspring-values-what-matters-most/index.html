<p>I come from a long list of companies that “talk the talk” about how valuable their employees are.  It comes from a good place, and it’s rarely insincere.  In my opinion, and you may disagree, most people are good people – even your boss and your boss’s boss.</p>
<p>However, “walking the walk” is extremely difficult, and my experience of the corporate world has shown me the implementation of all those good intentions usually turns out a little lack luster.  Treating everyone equally, rewarding good service, or fostering an open environment for communication is all fine and good when sales are up, negativity is down and there are only great things to say.  But there is often a huge disconnect between what a company <em>tells</em> their employees is encouraged, and what they show them when the going gets tough.<!--more--></p>
<p>Ever worked somewhere with an “Open Door” policy? Unofficially interprets itself as the “Open Door, but not, y’know, <em>That</em> Door” policy.</p>
<p>At previous jobs, I’ve been barked at, I’ve been told “my place”, and I’ve been scolded for trying to do more good the wrong way.  I am not alone in those experiences. Most people at most companies have dealt with these issues at some point.  All the Employee of the Month awards in the world can’t take away the sting of a reactionary reprimand.</p>
<p>And then there was Headspring.</p>
<p>Working at Headspring is a breath of honest to goodness fresh air.  Everything I ever believed about how a company should treat people - employees and customers alike - is right here in this space.</p>
<p>Headspring has a really interesting take on keeping the culture in check.  First of all, and like most companies, we have Core Values:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive for Excellence</li>
<li>People are Valued</li>
<li>Honest Communication</li>
<li>Passion for Learning and Growth</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These four values are the driving force behind every decision we make – top down, bottom up, etc.  If we have a policy, you can bet there has been a long, companywide discussion about how it touches each value.  Same goes for internal processes and procedures.  If anything conflicts with one of the values, we put it to test and revisit the drawing board. The values never change, and never will.  Everything revolves around them.</p>
<p>This is hard.  Is your boss prepared to open up all the financial statements of the company to every employee – including cash on hand – every month? Mine is. Is your boss prepared to lead an open discussion on what we want in a new office space or where it should be? Mine is. Is your boss ready to show you the hiring pipeline of candidates on a display big enough for the whole company to see? You guessed it; mine is. Just like our tagline, <strong>No Surprises</strong>.</p>
<p>Another way we keep the values in the forefront is through our Headspring Values Awards.  Each month, we email our Office Manager and People Are Valued Award Recipient, Rebecca Heath, with nominations for fellow teammates that have displayed these values in their everyday work.  The nominations are usually long and descriptive, sometimes emotional, and sometimes funny.  Nominations never expire, and there is no limit on the number that can be submitted per person.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;">When it’s time for our Monthly All Hands Meeting, Rebecca types up and distributes all the nominations.  The leadership team awards two a month, with a plaque, speech, and a handshake.  It’s worth mentioning that we get to read all the nominations, which is nearly as good as getting selected for an award.</span></p>
<p>“Yeah, only two were picked, but Alonso appreciated my work on our project, and wrote it down. I had feared maybe I was irritating him, but he appreciated that I challenged his ideas! I know this because the awards process is as open as anything else” – Sharon Cichelli, recent nominee</p>
<p>What’s important about this to me is that we nominate each other.  We decide.  We share.  Together, we keep the values from becoming cute or meaningless.  They are real and relevant every day.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;">Keeping the company in check is hard to do, but it helps to put your money where your mouth is.  We believe there is a better way to do business, to build software, and to run a company.</span></p>
<p>How does your company show you that you are valued?</p>
