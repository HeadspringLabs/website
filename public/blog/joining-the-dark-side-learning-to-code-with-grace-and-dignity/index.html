	<h2 class="title">Joining the Dark Side: Learning to Code With Grace and Dignity</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Upon the suggestion of a coworker I joined 342,787 people (and counting) with a 2012 resolution to learn how to code.  It’s called <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear</a>, presented by <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0">CodeAcademy</a>, supported by companies like YCombinator, and made viral by the addition of my fellow student, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/05/bloomberg-codecademy/">Michael Bloomberg</a>.   It’s a very simple, learn as you go platform, with big clean buttons and “dumbed down” explanations for the average Joe (or Jill).  I get an email every Monday with a new lesson to work on for the week.  As I progress, I earn badges and bragging rights to publish on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>There are a number of courses and levels to choose from, and I have just completed the first one, “Getting Started with Programming”.  After creating an account, I can sign in and access courses that I am working on and track my progress.</p>
<p>Here are a couple screen shots which demonstrate the clean design and learning module:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/joining-the-dark-side-learning-to-code-with-grace-and-dignity/code-academy-courses1-2" rel="attachment wp-att-3178"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3178" title="code academy courses1" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/code-academy-courses11-1024x554.png" alt="" width="614" height="332" /></a><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/joining-the-dark-side-learning-to-code-with-grace-and-dignity/code-academy-lesson1" rel="attachment wp-att-3155"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3155" title="code academy lesson1" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/code-academy-lesson1-1024x554.png" alt="" width="819" height="443" /></a></p>
<p>Now, let me take the time to clearly state that <strong>I have absolutely no intention of becoming a programmer</strong>. If I wanted to be a programmer, there are plenty of resources out there for entering a career in programming, all of which existed long before CodeAcademy came along.  What attracts me to this particular platform is that it is built specifically for non-technical people to learn how to think like a technical person when needed.</p>
<p>I can already tell this is going to be a very beneficial process for me.</p>
<p>I am surrounded by developers at work and at home, and I have found that they are a unique breed of communicators.  You see, in marketing, we care about the ideas, elaborating on them, and we don’t care much for the process of getting from A to B.</p>
<p><strong>Conversely, developers (good ones) care about the process just as much as they care about the conclusion</strong>.  Words, steps, and systems are really important to them.  They think the way code looks!  If a statement at the top of a string of code does not compute correctly, then the statement at the bottom of the string of code cannot compute either, <em>even if</em> that second statement is true.  Let me demonstrate with a snippet from Lesson 8 of “Getting Started with Programming”:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The while loop defined in the editor code won&#8217;t ever run because its condition, times <code>&gt;</code> 0 <code>&amp;&amp;</code>times <code>&lt;</code> 3, is never true since times <code>=</code> 0 and the two conditions 0 <code>&gt;</code> 0 <code>&amp;&amp;</code> 0 <code>&lt;</code> 3 evaluates tofalse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If the conditions of the loop aren&#8217;t met, the code will be skipped entirely.</p>
<p>Does this read like a familiar scenario? Now that I have been exposed to the process of coding, I am starting to notice the similarities between speaking to a developer and reading what a developer creates.</p>
<p>And the benefits don’t stop with enhanced communication.  I’m looking forward to being a more versatile teammate, not having to ask so many questions, and the possibility of using code to make my daily tasks easier.</p>
<p>But don’t take my word for it.  There are plenty of helpful blogs out there that detail the benefits of learning to code, like this one: <a href="http://www.giftrocket.com/why-marketing-bd-should-learn-to-code">10 Reasons Why Marketing and BD Professionals Should Learn to Code</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have ever considered learning how to code, I encourage you to visit <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear.com</a>, or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23codeyear">#codeyear</a> trending topic on Twitter (follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/headspring">@headspring</a> while you&#8217;re there).</p>
