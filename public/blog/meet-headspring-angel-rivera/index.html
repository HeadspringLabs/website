	<div class="entry-content"><p>Looking for a warmer place to live and the best city to raise a family, Angel Rivera touched down in Austin in 2010 with his wife. The couple grew their family with a son in 2011, and he is very proud. “My son takes my breath away. There’s no getting used to it, and there are new adventures every day. It gives me a whole new way of looking at life.” Angel joined our Headspring team in January, and we’re happy to have him!</p>

<p><b>What did you do before coming to Headspring?</b></p>
<p>I was born and raised in Puerto Rico where I went to college and graduated with a B.A. in graphic design.  I moved to Ohio when I was 21 years old. From there, I spent several years in Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota before I moved here for the long haul.</p>
<p><b>What do you love most about Austin?</b></p>
<p>The culture: laid-back, diverse, and relaxed. You can find everything from high-class restaurants to ones with a pet-friendly patio. There’s a little bit of everything for everyone.</p>
<p><b>What attracted you to Headspring?</b></p>
<p>I was attracted to the opportunity to work with a close-knit team, to the company culture, and to the opportunity to jump into the ever-changing software industry. I’m thankful for the opportunity!</p>
<p><b>How do you gauge “time well spent?&#8221;</b></p>
<p>When I’m being productive.</p>
<p><b>Who is your role model?</b></p>
<p>I would have to say my parents.  They were both very young when I was born. With no education, it must have been incredibly hard for them to raise both my sister and me, but they pulled it off.</p>
<p><b>What is your role at Headspring?</b></p>
<p>I’m a Business Development Consultant. I look for companies that would benefit from our services and who we can establish a strong business relationship with. A win-win.</p>
<p><b>What do you hope to accomplish professionally and personally in the next 5 years?</b></p>
<p>In the 11 years since Headspring was created, we have grown tremendously. I want to make sure Headspring continues to grow and expand so that every company out there knows how awesome we are.</p>
<p>Personally, I want to buy my mom a house in Puerto Rico. She is renting a small one-bedroom apartment right now and I think it’s time she has her own place again.</p>
<p><b>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?</b></p>
<p>I love watching movies and TV shows. The last movie I saw at the theater was Cabin in the Woods. I also enjoy playing video games (if I can find the time), playing my guitar, spending time with my family, going to the park and trying new restaurants. We’re foodies, and I especially love Thai food.</p>
<p><b>What’s your favorite Puerto Rican dish?</b></p>
<p>Rice, beans and chicken with fried plantains. There’s only one Puerto Rican restaurant – Chagos Restaurant – here. Their food is good but frankly, I cook better than they do, so I’m never homesick for Puerto Rican food!</p>
<p><b>What’s a tool you can’t live without?</b></p>
<p>Google Navigator, because I have a horrible sense of direction! I went to Puerto Rico during the Christmas holiday, and I got lost constantly because Google Maps doesn’t work there!</p>
<p><b>Any social media links?</b></p>
