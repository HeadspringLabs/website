<div class="entry-content"><p>Chances are, if you’re reading this you’re a member of at least one loyalty program. While the days of the key ring with a dozen fobs are fading into the rear view mirror, the proliferation of rewards programs won’t be stopping any time soon. As an original member Burger King kids club (I was the one with the green sunglasses and skateboard) I’ve seen a lot of really cool loyalty programs, and I’ve also seen some really ineffective ones. A poorly executed loyalty program can alienate your most valuable customers, and cost you a hell of a lot of money doing it. Here are the most common mistakes that companies make.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>1. They discount the wrong things</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a baseball team, don’t offer discounted season tickets as one of your perks. I had one National League Executive tell me “Season Tickets are by definition a loyalty system. We’re already rewarding them for volume purchases.” Think about your high margin items by offering a discount on parking or concessions.</p>
<p>There are always going to be loopholes in whatever discounts you give. I watch extreme couponing. I remember the grocery store paying my dad to buy cornflakes. Extra-plain Cornflakes that I had to choke down every morning for a year. Give incremental discounts that are large enough to be noticed by your customers, but not on bread-and-butter products that they make the COO roll his eyes in company meetings.</p>
<p>A great example of this is a national grocery chain that discounts its bulk coffee. They’re already making solid margins on this line of business, but their customers have no real compelling reason to keep their coffee purchases in-house. The grocery chain came up with a stair-step program where customers could “unlock” a 10% discount by purchasing a predetermined amount of coffee. This kept margins high, and increased the volume 30% of a profitable part of their business.</p>
<p><strong>2. They spam their best customers</strong></p>
<p>I love it when Drugstore.com reminds me that I have a bonus $10.00 in Drugstore cash that I need to burn before the end of the month. You’re never going to make an enemy by doing that. I’ve noticed that they contact me most frequently when they have good news for me, and keep the “check out our ‘Brand X’ line” emails to a maximum of once a quarter. Yep, I take advantage on their sales, but I also stay loyal and buy from them every time instead of chancing it with another, less reputable website that might save a couple of bucks here or there.</p>
<p>There are a few lists that I’ve been on that have felt like spam right from the get-go. This usually happens when I get put on a list halfway through a marketing campaign that unbeknownst to me was started a month beforehand. I get a bunch of messages with their company-specific jargon and catch-phrases that I just don’t understand. I feel disconnected from the company and I won’t have any second-thoughts about unsubscribing. The best companies are the ones who have one or two emails for people who have just joined their club to ease them in. Take me out to dinner first.</p>
<p><strong>3. They overestimate how involved their customers want to be</strong></p>
<p>Every day I see a car with an “Apple” sticker on the window. Not every company out there has a loyal enough following to the point that their customers will turn their cars into moving billboards. Don’t assume that clients will wear your swag just because you have a happy customer. It doesn’t mean that you won’t get to that point, just don’t make the mistake of thinking that you’re more involved in your customer’s lives than you really are.<br />
Case-in-point- DIRECTV. I’ve been a subscriber for a few years and I get sick of their constant emails. I even get sick of hearing that they’ll give me a hundred dollars for referring a friend. I buy all kinds of extra packages from those guys, but their customer service is just so difficult that I will never be excited to hear from them. I fall into the category of “once there are other options for Sunday Ticket, I’m out.” Yet somehow, I get calls from them, packages of stickers, and emails 4 times a week (including the ones that tell me that prices are rising on my next bill.)</p>
