			Becoming a Headspringer: My First Week</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2 dir="ltr">Welcome Number 7941</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d like for you to take a moment and imagine that today is your first day at a new company.  You enter the building wearing the carefully selected slacks and shirt ironed the night before.  You&#8217;re filled with nervous energy, but confident, because out of the fifty plus candidates, who did they select to write their new custom software solution?  That&#8217;s right, you.</p>
<p>The friendly HR rep that recruited you shakes your hand and leads you to a large conference room where you attend a new hire orientation.  You&#8217;re promptly handed an employee handbook the size of a telephone book and sit down.  Opening to a random page on Computer/IT Usage policies you learn that it&#8217;s against company policies to look at **cough** questionable **cough** images on company computers.  Interesting, you think to yourself, I figured that was common knowledge.</p>
<p>Over the next four hours you listen to HR representatives speak about company history, company policies, and benefits.  You fill out form after form of information asking for social security numbers, driver&#8217;s license number, passport number and other private information.  You&#8217;re handed a badge with an employee number, 7941.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/04/becoming-a-headspringer-my-first-week/cubicle-hell" rel="attachment wp-att-4917"><img class="size-full wp-image-4917 aligncenter" title="Sea of Cubicles" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/cubicle-hell.jpg" alt="Sea of Cubicles" width="650" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>Next they take you on a tour of the office.  On the first floor is sales, marketing and HR.  On the second floor is Engineering.  At this point you&#8217;ve been blasted with so much canned information that mentally you only take note of the bathroom locations.</p>
<p>The elevator door opens on the third floor and your tour guide herds your group through the sea of Customer Service cubicles until you reach the IT department and HR hands you off to your new tour guide, your manager.  He or she introduces you to the entire team and leaves you in your cubicle.  Sitting down, you realize you don&#8217;t have a computer at your desk.  You think to yourself, what does a software developer do without a computer?</p>
<p>How many of you have a page, just like this, written in your life story?  How many of you have felt like a number, like you weren&#8217;t valued?  At Headspring, there’s a better way&#8230;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Four Core Values</h2>
<p>Let me start off by saying, at Headspring, things are different.  You quickly learn the following four core values are deeply held at the core of a Headspringer.</p>
<p>- Drive for Excellence<br />
- People are Valued<br />
- Honest Communication<br />
- Passion for Learning and Growth</p>
<p>Within the first week, time and time again I witnessed Headspringers demonstrating these four values in every interaction.  Let me take a few moments to detail just a few of them.<br />
A week before my start date I received a delivery of piping hot, freshly baked cookies from the founder and CEO, Dustin Wells.  Now I&#8217;m definitely not known to have a sweet tooth, but the cookies were just plain awesome; and seriously, how cool is that to have the owner of the company value me as a new hire?</p>
<p>Three business days before my start date, I received an email from the director of software development, Glenn Burnside.  I was the proud owner of a shiny new Headspring Google account.  Being a naturally curious person, I logged in to find ten or more introduction emails to various systems such as the Intranet, BitBucket repositories, and Agile Zen Projects.  Wow, I haven&#8217;t started yet and I&#8217;m already trusted with sensitive information such as the admin credentials to the production server.  This level of transparent communication across an organization was and still is amazing to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/04/becoming-a-headspringer-my-first-week/headstream094" rel="attachment wp-att-4918"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4918" title="Headspring Offices" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/headstream094.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="289" /></a></p>
<p>On my first day at the Headspring office I arrived to find my desk already outfitted with business cards, moleskine journals, a Headspring shirt, and most importantly a fully configured laptop with two 24&#8221; monitors.  When I say fully configured, I don&#8217;t mean it has RAM, a working Hard Drive and is plugged in.  I mean that it&#8217;s fully configured with almost every software development tool that I use, from TestDriven.Net to Notepad++ to Redgate SQL Toolbelt.  I only downloaded and installed the obscure tools that I use such as Beyond Compare, Wunderlist, gVim, and Cygwin.  By the end of the day, with guidance from teammates, I was up and running, tackling tasks in the backlog.</p>
<p>Four days into the new job and I had my first one-on-one meeting with Glenn.  Here we talked candidly about expectations and goals.  The conversation drifted towards the on ramp process and during that discussion he asked for my opinion and took a suggestion I had on the process.<br />
That&#8217;s when it hit me.  The four core values are a deep commitment at Headspring starting from the top leadership all the way down.  Glenn had taken something so simple like the on ramp process of a new employee and the drive for excellence had motivated everyone to thoughtfully deconstruct and improve the process.  This is what it means to be a Headspringer.</p>
<p>Working at Headspring has already been an amazing experience.  It&#8217;s a pleasure to work with individuals who have a deep passion and commitment to developing not only software, but each other.  So I feel compelled to ask you this question.  What&#8217;s keeping you from <a href="http://www.headspring.com/about-us/careers">applying</a>?</p>

			Architecture Resists Change</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In a conversation about large software projects, the word &#8220;architecture&#8221; is bound to come up sooner or later.  Most programmers have a gut feeling for what this really means with regard to software, but if you asked 10 programmers to define it, you&#8217;d get 10 different answers.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf">Who Needs an Architect?</a>, Martin Fowler covers a few definitions which he ultimately boils down to one simple concept: <strong>architecture is the decisions that are hard to change.</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the tone you use when reading that definition, it&#8217;s almost a <em>pejorative</em>.  Joel Spolsky even warned us of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">Architecture Astronauts</a>, people who effectively over-engineer and abstract things to the point that they&#8217;re no longer solving real problems.</p>
<p>Yes, <strong>an</strong> architecture can be bad.  If the decisions that are hard to change form obstacles between you and the true goal of your project, you&#8217;ve got a bad architecture.  On the other hand, some decisions that are hard to change may be a driving force for your success.  It&#8217;s just important to be aware of which decisions form your architecture as you make them.</p>
<h2>Example: The Onion Architecture</h2>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/onion-architecture-part-4-after-four-years">Onion Architecture</a>, the hard-to-change decision is to define realtively-unstable infrastructure on the outside, depending on a core application that is ignorant of infrastructure details like persistence.</p>
<p>This decision is hard to change, but it is justified.  As Jeffrey Palermo said during a presentation on the O.A., an assembly is only as stable as its least-stable dependency.  Therefore, for an application to stand the test of time, we need to maximize the stable portion and minimize our dependency on things that are too likely to change.  If your app integrates with Twitter today, it likely won&#8217;t in 5 years after Twitter goes the way of the blue Dodo bird, so you are better off defining your Twitter integration outside of the core assembly, dependent on the core assembly rather than the other way around.</p>
<h2>Example: Parsley</h2>
<p>A few months back I described a hobby project to illustrate <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/recognizing-covariance-issues-in-your-code">covariance issues</a>.  This project lets you parse text by describing what a valid input looks like (similar to regular expressions).  There were two key decisions that would be impossible to change without starting from scratch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the user would describe what a valid input looks like by gluing together tiny <a href="http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/127">side-effect-free</a> functions.<br />
  Second, I would use read-only data structures to represent progress through the input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two decisions are made frequently when using functional languages, but not so much in C# projects.  Despite being unusual, I found these decisions to be extremely helpful for this kind of problem, regardless of the language used to implement it.</p>
<p>The samples contain a <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley/blob/0b0b1cdddab040c1513344f3b768a8c348bed138/src/Parsley.Test/IntegrationTests/Json/JsonGrammar.cs">JSON parser</a>, which amounts to describing what valid JSON looks like.  The bulk of the description is summed up in a few lines:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2495421.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Because of the two architectural decisions, all the details about tracking progress, success, and failure can be completely hidden.  The user can solve the task at hand by describing the task at hand, and the architectural decisions enable that ability.</p>
<h2>Making Your Own Decisions</h2>
<p>As you make a decision that affects your project&#8217;s structure, ask yourself, &#8220;Is this a part of our architecture?  Is it going to be hard to change later if we go forward with it?  If so, does it <em>earn the right</em> to be included anyway?&#8221;  If not, try to restructure it so that it <em>is</em> easy to change, or consider chucking it entirely.</p>

			MVP vs MVC: Seeking Better Testability</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s something nice about returning to an old design pattern. Comparing it with the pattern you&#8217;re currently using gives you new insights about both.</p>
<p>When I was writing ASP.NET WebForms apps, my team organized the UI layer with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">MVP (Model View Presenter)</a> pattern, preferring the Passive View variant. This allowed us to write Views that were small and lean, pulling as much logic as possible out of that untestable wasteland of UI markup and code-behind. More recently, I&#8217;ve been developing ASP.NET MVC applications (using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC (Model View Controller)</a> pattern, naturally), and I like how my Views can be straightforward HTML with a few fill-in-the-blank spots for the data I want to display; much simpler to understand than the old WebForms server controls. But my most recent project, I wrote in <a href="http://windowsclient.net/wpf/">WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)</a> due to some specific needs of the client, and I had to re-open the UI design pattern question. I decided on MVP, and this gave me a great opportunity to contrast the two patterns.</p>
<p>My goal in choosing <em>any</em> pattern is readable, understandable code. Even if I&#8217;m the only developer on the project, reading my own code, if six months have elapsed, it might as well have been written by someone else. Patterns inherently give structure, but more importantly, they are recognizable. Reading the code, you can spot it: &#8220;Oh! This is an MVP app. Okay, I&#8217;ll look for a Presenter class to be managing the interactions with the View. &#8230;There it is!&#8221; Future maintainers and enhancers (including your Future Self) will appreciate your consistency; patterns help you write &#8220;No Surprises&#8221; software. Both MVP and MVC meet this criterion; they are recognizable patterns, each with a distinctive fingerprint.</p>
<p>My secondary pattern-choosing criterion is testability: How well does this pattern let me cover every interesting part of my app with unit tests? While I see the value in integration tests and full-system tests, I&#8217;m strongly prejudiced against them. Integration tests are finicky, and full-system tests are slow. I&#8217;m unapologetically feisty about my unit tests. The better pattern is the one that not only makes it easy to test, but makes it <em>hard</em> to write untestable code. In other words, prefer the pattern that leads your team to fall into the &#8221;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2003/10/02/50420.aspx">pit of success</a>.&#8221; MVC beats MVP on this point. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Consider a continuum, from Untestable Scary Code to Clean, Verified Code. WebForms without the rigor of an MVP pattern, with heavy reliance on the code-behind, is far on the left of that continuum. A lot of business logic and application flow control can be hidden in the least testable layer. When you apply MVP to your WebForms app, the pattern guides you to write very slim code-behind files, with methods that are usually one line long, immediately deferring to the Presenter. This is closer to the middle of the continuum, where you can test your Presenters, provided you trust your Views to remain humble and hand over control promptly. MVC, as implemented by the ASP.NET MVC framework, gives you <strong>no code-behind files</strong>. There&#8217;s no temptation to put logic into the View because there&#8217;s hardly anywhere to put it. Control logic naturally fits in the Controller, which is a plain class you can instantiate and exercise in a unit test. The easiest path produces the cleanest result. Nice.</p>
<p>Why did I use MVP at all? It&#8217;s necessary in a framework that brings the View into existence first. Both WebForms and WPF start a conversation with the user by locating and instantiating a View. The View then constructs its Presenter and injects itself into it. MVC implementations start by instantiating a Controller. Unlike MVP Views, which have to talk to their Presenters, MVC Views can remain ignorant of their Controllers, and this allows them to stay logic-free and focused on rendering the UI. When using MVP, it takes vigilance to make sure your Views never do anything interesting, anything you&#8217;ll later wish you had covered with a unit test. And anything that takes vigilance is likely to drift over time.</p>
<p>It was fun to revisit my &#8220;old&#8221; way of structuring applications, because it made me think critically about the relative merits of MVP versus MVC. I had an instinctive feeling for which one I preferred, and comparing them helped me see explicitly that MVC increases my confidence in the correctness of my team&#8217;s code.</p>

			Increasing Development Enjoyment With RavenDB</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We have a lot of different options for data storage and retrieval available today. These options include the traditional relational database, document databases, key value stores, and even flat files. Every option has its benefits over the others, making some options better for some things and other options better for other things. Once the data storage and retrieval option is selected, we then typically have to select a product. Within a solution space, most products offer some distinction from their competitors. Such distinctions make certain products popular choices for a particular technology stack. For example, MySQL is a common choice for the LAMP stack, as is Microsoft SQL Server for the .NET stack.</p>
<p>Why is this so? There are several reasons for this, and their importance varies between administrators, developers, managers, and even executives.</p>
<p>From a developer&#8217;s point of view, it comes down to whether or not the product in the solution space makes the work more enjoyable.</p>
<p>As a .NET developer, <a href="http://ravendb.net">RavenDB</a> is a ton of fun to work with. Here is what it offers me:</p>
<ol>
<li>RavenDB is available as a <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet</a> package, which means I don’t even have to leave Visual Studio to start working with it.</li>
<li>The .NET client is very well designed and supports the IQueryable interface and LINQ very well.  This makes storing, deleting, and loading data easy. It also makes querying data easy and extremely powerful.</li>
<li>Facilities to quickly define indexes and even MapReduce queries in code with minimal effort are supported.</li>
<li>The amount of time I spend on the data model is greatly reduced, since mapping .NET objects to JSON documents is easy.</li>
<li>I don’t have to use an object relational mapper (ORM).</li>
<li>An HTTP API is available as an integration option.</li>
<li>I can completely embed RavenDB in my application.</li>
</ol>
<p>The net result is I can spend most of my time focused on my application and its problem space. Reasons 4 and 5 are also true for other document databases, but reasons 1, 2, and 3 really distinguish RavenDB in the .NET space.</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. Take for instance reason #4 and assume we were tasked with creating a domain model for a shopping cart and the persistence logic for it.  The very first thing we would do is create the domain model. After some conversations and collaboration with a stakeholder, we come up with the following initial domain model along with the unit tests which validate the correct behavior of the model:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2399488.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>At this point we are ready to start working on persisting the shopping cart object to a database. If we are using Microsoft SQL Server, we would now have to create some tables in SQL or perhaps use a code-first approach with our ORM of choice. We may need to create a map for our ORM and probably a repository class to facilitate the storage and retrieval of our domain object to and from the database. If we are using RavenDB, we are pretty much done. Regardless of the data storage solution selected, we can usually count on some tweaks and enhancements during the demo and develop iterations with the stakeholder. But when RavenDB is used, those changes are going to happen here in the domain model. Contrast this with a traditional relational database, which may require changes to the domain model, ORM maps, repositories, and SQL tables.</p>
<p>I can’t get over how easy the .NET client is to use and how powerful RavenDB can be. If you are interested in trying RavenDB out, check out my <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb">Getting Started with RavenDB</a> post for a quick introduction.</p>
