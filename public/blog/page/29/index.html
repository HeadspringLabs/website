  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you on the verge of a mutiny?</p>
<p>For my Mom&#8217;s birthday I decided it would be nice if I bought her a computer. (Moms are funny; she had purchased three PCs for my brother and me before we were out of the house, but she never had the desire to learn to use one herself.)</p>
<p>We went out to the electronics store one day to pick out the one that she wanted. Her two biggest requirements were that she needed to access washingtonpost.com, and she wanted to learn to play Scrabble online. We ended up picking out a pretty generic machine with a decent amount of memory and some antivirus software for all of the &#8220;free iPod&#8221; ads I was sure she would click on.</p>
<p>This was six years ago, and she was happy as she could be. I was too, albeit completely unprepared for how good she would get at Scrabble. Then I had to go and screw it all up.</div>

<p>One: It sounded like a good idea at the time.</p>
<p>As strange as it may sound, the BCS system was created to solve a problem. The old way of crowning a national champion failed for the first time in 1992. Mark Brunell&#8217;s Washington Huskies had won their bowl game and finished the season undefeated. In most seasons this would have been enough to secure the national championship, but this year was different. The University of Miami (featuring Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson) had likewise finished the regular season undefeated and pummeled Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. Although The Rock would go on to claim to be &#8220;The People&#8217;s Champion,&#8221; the national title was declared a tie. Everyone threw a big fit because there were two national champions, and America doesn&#8217;t do ties. Something had to be doneâ€”and the solution was to be the Bowl Championship Series. The BCS ranking formula would include the opinions of people who talk about sports on TV, coaches who are allowed to vote for their own teams, and six computers that would calculate secret algorithms. What could possibly go wrong?</div>
