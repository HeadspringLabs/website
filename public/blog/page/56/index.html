			Review of Robert Martin&#8217;s the Clean Coder</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Humans learn from experience. Learning to be a consultant is a pinnacle of this idea- you cannot pick up a book, read it, work a few exercises in an isolated setting, and be a consultant. However, The Clean Coder by Robert Martin puts readers in the right direction and starts them down the path to being a true professional by giving the reader both a code of conduct to live by and plethora of stories detailing Martin&#8217;s own experiences and pitfalls. This second-hand experience is the best possible resource that can be put into text, and while it will not guarantee that the reader will never make spills of their own, it reveals several of the obvious- and not so obvious- pitfalls that are on the path to being a professional developer.</p>
<p>This book is thin, but a very dense read; it covers a true variety of subjects, many of which that are crucial for consultants - when and how to say no and yes professionally, test driven development, project management, teamwork, and estimation, to name several. But it is because of this wealth of topics that Martin is able to show readers that professionalism and the path to a long and respected career involves dedication, practice, and time.</p>
<p>This is a book I would recommend not only to new software professionals, but experienced ones as well- because Martin also delves into the more detailed issues of professionalism and career development, even established professionals might learn a thing or two. There is also a section on mentoring that should prove useful to current professionals- because sharing knowledge is just as, if not more, important than obtaining it.</p>
<p>Overall, this book provides a solid foundation for any new software development career by giving the reader contextual experience as well as well-thought-out, time-tested rules to govern the start of a new (or existing) career as a software developer. The Clean Coder pulls all of these important topics into a central text, lending a much-needed resource to the software development community.</p>

			Requirement Gathering Techniques | Drawing 101</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If it can&#8217;t be drawn, it can&#8217;t be built. It’s the mantra in our office. Having heard it almost every day that I have been here at Headspring, I never really understood its power before I set out on the (thought to be exciting) task of rebuilding the company website.</p>
<p>I knew I’d have to gather requirements for the site. Having no idea of what requirement gathering techniques were out there I just started a word document list: pages, forms, content.  When I sat down with the team to start developing the site, they needed more information about site flow.</p>
<p>I tried explaining with my 17 page word document, highlighted and notes scribbled on the side, but no one was getting it (including myself). When one brilliant person suggested that we draw it out, markers opened and the drawing began: home page, top-nav pages, children pages, forms and so on.</p>
<p>When we were done the picture finally became clear. All my requirements, even those that I had forgotten about, were there and easy to follow. No matter what you’re building, please learn from my mistake and start off drawing your requirements, because if it can’t be drawn, it can’t be built.</p>

			PowerShell and the Principle of Most Astonishment</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When designing a user interface, it&#8217;s important to avoid conflicts between what an action actually does and what the user <em>expects</em> it to do. Our goal is to minimize surprises to ensure a smooth end-user experience. This is called the <a title="Principle of Least Astonishment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principle of Least Astonishment</a>.</p>
<p>This principle should also be important to language designers. Just like a slick, AJAX-y web page is a user interface for the end user, a programming language&#8217;s syntax is a user interface for developers. When the rules of a language conflict with a typical developer&#8217;s mental model of what the rules <em>might</em> be, we have a problem every bit as serious as a confusing user-facing dialog.</p>
<p>After running into some hurdles using PowerShell, it seems that this language follows the Principle of <em>Most</em> Astonishment. Because its actual model conflicts with the mental model most developers take for granted in similar languages, it is very easy to run into some frustrating bugs.</p>
<p>Programming lanaguages can be dropped into several broad categories when they encourage similar mental models. For the Imperative Object-Oriented Languages, this makes it easy to start with Python and then learn Ruby, Java, and the like: they all have roughly similar notions of imperative control flow, classes, methods, arguments, return values, and I/O. Since PowerShell is an imperative .NET language, it is all too easy to make incorrect assumptions about how PowerShell will behave, even in the simplest of programs.</p>
<p>When learning PowerShell, it&#8217;s important to avoid bringing all this imperative language baggage along for the ride. Start by realizing that <strong>PowerShell functions are not functions</strong>! Rather, they are commands.</p>
<p>PowerShell is meant to replace old-school BAT files and as such its syntax and semantics lean heavily towards command-line instructions where I/O is king. In most imperative languages, functions take in arguments and return values, occasionally performing side-effects like I/O. In PowerShell, commands take in arguments, and then <strong>output values throughout their execution</strong>. The caller of a PowerShell command can often pretend that it is returning a value upon its completion, but it is always more accurate to say that all of the side-effect output of a command is made available to the caller upon its completion. Consider a simple function which intends to calculate some values while only returning a single value:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1114530.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>If we call this command with $x = 1, the caller receives an <em>array</em> as the return value. The array contains three values: [1, 2, 3]. What&#8217;s going on here? First, every expression that gets evaluated will be included in the output. When multiple values are output like this, they get packaged up into an array for you. Second, using the &#8216;return&#8217; keyword with a value on the right-hand-side is misleading. Use the &#8216;return&#8217; keyword only when you need to exit from a command early. The above code is actually equivalent to the following:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1114545.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>&#8220;return 5&#8221; really means &#8220;include 5 in the array of output and then return control to the caller&#8221;. Imagine how frustrating it can be to run into a problem like this. You start adding print statements to your buggy function in order to diagnose what is happening, and the very act of writing that output changes its return value!</p>
<p>There are ways to prevent expressions from being returned to the caller. You can use the built-in command <strong>write-host</strong> to write output to the console without it being included in the output array. Assignment statements are also suppressed from the output because they represent intermediate work being performed.</p>
<p>Any developer who approaches the first Output-And-Return definition above will make false assumptions about the behavior of the command. By recognizing that the PowerShell model differs from a typical model of functions-returning-values, you too can avoid mind-boggling debugging sessions.</p>

			Jazz-Up Your CSS With Transitions</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While JavaScript has historically been the go-to technology for animating CSS properties, CSS 3 brings us transitions: a declarative syntax for defining the transition between styles.</p>
<p>Adding transitions to your CSS is quite simple. First, define the &#8220;start&#8221; and &#8220;end&#8221; states of your HTML elements as separate rules, like so.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1114324.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Then, add the appropriate properties for transitioning your elements to both states (necessary since we&#8217;ll be transitioning both <em>to</em> and <em>from</em> each state). Since the transitions specification <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/" target="_blank">hasn&#8217;t been finalized</a>, you&#8217;ll need to add some vendor-specific rules to support the majority of modern browsers. I&#8217;ve found <a title="CSS3Please" href="http://css3please.com/" target="_blank">CSS3Please</a> to be an invaluable resource for this, as I always forget the correct vendor syntax to use.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1114331.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Each of these lines, for the browser it targets, sets the following properties for animation:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;all&#8221;: The name of the property to animate (in this case, all of them).</li>
<li>&#8220;0.5s&#8221;: The duration of the animation in seconds.</li>
<li>&#8220;ease&#8221;: A description of how the animation will behave over time. Experiment with some of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#transition-timing-function" target="_blank">other variations</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>For your convenience, here&#8217;s a JSFiddle so you can try it out yourself. Click on the &#8220;CSS&#8221; tab to see all the stylistic goodness and the &#8220;Result&#8221; tab to see it in action (assuming you&#8217;re using a modern browser, of course).</p>
<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" src="http://jsfiddle.net/TimGThomas/vKB8N/embedded/result,html,css,js" width="320" height="240"></iframe></p>

			How to Add a Method to ViewBag in ASP.NET MVC</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We are all familiar with the basic HomeController in the default ASP.NET MVC project.  We know we can pass values from the controller to the view.  Sometimes we are tempted to pass the controller itself to the view so that we can call methods on it.  The view should not have to depend on the controller.  This post provides a way to accomplish this.  For more on ASP.NET MVC, check out my book, <a href="http://bit.ly/aspnetmvc3inaction">ASP.NET MVC 3 in Action</a>.  You can also check out the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/headspring/mvc-boot-camp/" target="_blank">MVC Boot Camp</a> training we offer at <a href="http://www.headspring.com">Headspring</a>.  We start with the HomeController.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image2.png"><img style="border: 0px;" alt="image" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb2.png" width="530" height="403" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We know from just a little reading that the ViewBag property on HomeController is a dynamic object – using the new .Net 4 dynamic capabilities.  Merely setting the Message property on the object creates the property.  It is not completely obvious how to create a new method on the object, though.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>If I were to want to use a method in my Razor view like this&#8230;</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image3.png"><img style="border: 0px;" alt="image" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb3.png" width="535" height="274" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>&#8230; then I would need to figure out how to get the GetCurrentTime() method onto the ViewBag.  The following is the solution to that problem.</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>There are two technical capabilities of C# 4 that provide the ability to accomplish our new method.  The first is that I can create and set any new property on the dynamic object.  The second is actually a feature of .Net 2 – delegates.  I will create a method and then wrap it in a delegate and assign it as a property of ViewBag.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image4.png"><img style="border: 0px;" alt="image" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb4.png" width="538" height="344" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>.Net 3.5 brought us the Func&lt;&gt; and the lambda expressions.  These make delegates so much more concise to write and read.  I have now create a method, assigned it to a object and set it as a property on ViewBag.</p>
<p>The only thing left to do is to dereference the property and invoke it with ().</p>
<p>For those of you who have been programming for a while, you know that I technically haven’t create a method on the ViewBag object.  That is correct.  We have to think back to why I asked for the method in the first place.</p>
<h1>Why do we need methods?</h1>
<p>We need methods in order to retrieve values that are resolved at run time.  For instance, if I need to pass in some view-specific value to my ViewBag for evaluation, I need a method. If you were ever tempted to pass a reference to the controller to the view just to be able to execute a method on a value the controller owned, this is your ticket to accomplishing that.  Because the method/closure/delegate in the controller has full scope access to the controller memory space, the ViewBag now holds the gateway to the controller’s state that is necessary.</p>
