		<p>At Headspring, we’re proud to have amazing leaders who are experts in the industry. Jimmy Bogard, our Technical Architect, not only excels at Headspring but also enthusiastically participates in the global development community. He recently went on a “world tour” to teach and meet developers in Ireland, England and Ukraine.  Jimmy had the opportunity to speak to the following groups. For more information about what information was presented at each event, <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/12/17/dublin-alt-net-skills-matter-kiev-alt-net-slides-code/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the way we program is universally similar, it’s interesting to think about how similar and different developers are around the world. Here’s what Jimmy had to say about his experience:</p>
<p><em>“One of the insights I found consistent in conversations from all the developers is that it seems that no matter where I go, the problems and passions remain the same. Everyone&#8217;s smart, everyone&#8217;s passionate, and the things developers’ care about are similar everywhere. We read the same blogs, books, and even use the same gadgets (when we can afford them). The only global issue was whether to code in English. People don&#8217;t pick English just because an American or Brit is on the team.  What if there are Ukrainians, French or Danes on the same team? The common language is English. We have a hard enough time picking a programming language, but picking a spoken language is even more interesting!”</em></p>

			Calm-Driven Development</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Years ago, when I was young and crazy, the tail end of a long-term project would be rushed and hectic.  A seemingly arbitrary deadline would approach, and despite (or because of) everyone putting in long hours, the remaining work would far exceed the amount of time left.  Major features would still be in active development, QA would find serious bugs left and right, and there seemed to be no hope. (To be clear: the blame falls on me as much as anyone.)</p>
<p>This week, the team I&#8217;ve been working with for a year is wrapping up a large project.  Over the last several weeks, everybody&#8217;s stress level has visibly <em>lessened</em>.  The urgency of incoming tasks has lessened, the backlog is being evaluated for risk versus reward, but truly-important issues are rightly being called out and divided among the team.</p>
<p>Contrasting this year&#8217;s experience with older, troubled projects, here are the things that appear to account for the difference:</p>
<h2>Sustainable Pace</h2>
<p>Headspring sticks to a 40-hour work week, and everyone on the org chart takes that seriously.  I&#8217;ve worked long hours in the past, and somewhere around hour 43 I start to produce poor work; really awful stuff which would inevitably spill into following weeks.  Recharging at this pace is both easy and necessary.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re facing death marches, it can often feel like it is out of your control.  Both you and those setting deadlines may feel like putting in extra hours is the only &#8216;lever&#8217; you can pull.  Consider, though, where the deadline pressure is coming from.  For instance, it may be that some vital core functionality needs to be in production to coincide with a marketing push, or to integrate with a third party&#8217;s own timetable.  The death march pressure you experience might just be intended to alleviate fears that the <em>vital parts</em> will miss their due date.  If you can then alleviate those fears through other, more sustainable means, death march pressure and long hours may stop feeling quite so necessary.  These alternatives may include frequent demos of recent progress on vital features, frank discussions of feature and defect priorities, and raising issues as early as possible.  When both sides are in on all this information, both sides have more levers to pull.</p>
<h2>Consistent Estimation</h2>
<p>This actually goes hand in hand with keeping a sustainable pace.  When you are overworked and asked to give reliable estimates for 100 tasks spread out over the next 3 months, you&#8217;re tempted to take the number of workday hours in 3 months and divide that by 100.  Surely it&#8217;ll be wrong, but you&#8217;ll make it all up on the weekend, right?  By <em>having</em> to succeed while sticking to a 40 hour week, my estimates have gotten far more accurate, even when estimates are expected in terms of hours rather than some other measurement like relative complexity.  Sometimes I&#8217;m a little over, sometimes I&#8217;m a little under, but once I was exposed to this particular project for a while, it became easier and easier to get extremely accurate with my estimates.  My estimates now <em>mean</em> something that stakeholders can rely on, and the gentle pressure of sticking to 40 hours helped to retrain my brain.</p>
<h2>Write. Down. Everything.</h2>
<p> In past projects, my approach to note-taking was unorganized.  On this project, I&#8217;ve gotten better about this, and it has paid off: I don&#8217;t waste time rediscovering information, from day to day and from month to month.  See <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/memory-management/">Memory Management</a> for more on my new note-taking habits.</p>
<h2>The End of the World/Project</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a little surprised to find that all the most-evident parts to our success don&#8217;t even get into <em>technical</em> concerns.  Of course, technical details are always involved in a single day&#8217;s thousand little decisions, but when talking about the health of such a long project with so many contributors, <em>human</em> concerns dominate success.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Men#Overview">The world may very well end with a bang today.</a>  Only the ancient Mayans and Neil deGrasse Tyson know for sure.  This project, on the other hand, ends with not even a whimper.  It&#8217;s not grand, and it&#8217;s not exciting.  It&#8217;s downright boring, and that&#8217;s quite a step forward.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h2>Windows Installer is Actually A Feature</h2>
<p>Something many Windows users are unaware of is that there is actually a feature in Windows called &#8220;Windows Installer&#8221;.  You won&#8217;t find it listed in Programs and Features in the Control Panel, but its included in the same way as a feature almost all Windows users have encountered (and cursed) called Windows Update.  You can see a release history and the default version shipped with the various Windows operating systems <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa371185.aspx">here.</a></p>
<h2>Basic Features</h2>
<p>Windows Installer has a number of features that make it attractive to use.  The foremost is transactional operations:  if an error occurs while installing (or uninstalling) your software, Windows Installer is able to rollback all of the changes made so far and revert the computer back to its state before the operation began.  This means the system will never be left in a half installed state.</p>
<p>Also highly useful is the capability to add Start menu, quick launch, and Desktop shortcuts for the users to easily start your software.</p>
<p>Another feature is the ability to do repairs.  Imagine a user is trying to free up disk space on their hard drive and unwittingly deletes some of your application files.  Windows Installer provides a mechanism that allows an installed program to be repaired, where any missing files are replaced.</p>
<p>Windows Installer also has a number of capabilities to control file sprawl and minimize disk usage.  With plummeting storage costs these capabilities aren&#8217;t as important as they once were, but if your application is very large then they&#8217;re still useful.  Windows Installer can track versions of your application and perform in place upgrades and patches so a user doesn&#8217;t have to completely install the entire application (which could take a long time if the application has a lot of physical files).  On demand install allows features of an application to appear available, but they aren&#8217;t actually installed on the machine until used, saving disk space.</p>
<h2>Custom Actions</h2>
<p>One very compelling ability is custom actions.  Custom actions can be written in C++, C#, and others and invoked in the middle of your install.  This allows you to add any sort of capability you need to have during the middle of the install process.  There are several caveats to go along with this power however.  First, make sure you&#8217;re not baking in some sort of setup that will need to be run outside the installer as a normal maintenance operation.  Second, sometimes what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish might not be worth the effort to make a custom action when it can be done in normal application code.  I&#8217;m not saying to never use custom actions, but just be careful not to turn them into a golden hammer to drive in everything, including screws.</p>
<h2>Other Advanced Features</h2>
<p>There are a plethora of other features aimed at big enterprises that are worth a passing mention.  Administrative install allows a network admin to  &#8221;install&#8221; onto on a network share location, and then users can install the application from that network share.  This allows the admin to ensure that users get the application installed in a consistent manner, reducing maintenance time.  Windows Installer can also be used to perform unattended installs so that an application can be pushed and installed in an automatic fashion, saving IT staff from having to make the rounds of hundreds or thousands of desks.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>You can see a fairly comprehensive list of the features <a title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa367449(v=vs.85).aspx" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa367449(v=vs.85).aspx">here</a>.  You&#8217;re probably not going to avail yourself to all of the more advanced functionality, but many of the simpler benefits (transactional operations, shortcuts, custom actions, and repairs) are a big win for a local Windows client application.</p>

<h2>What Kinds of Software Projects Benefit From an Installer?</h2>
<p>So you&#8217;ve invested in creating a Windows application of some kind and you&#8217;re ready to distribute it so others can use it.  Maybe that means making it available for sale to millions of outside people, or perhaps it means handing it off to your IT administrator.  How are the finished bits going to get to a place they can be used?</p>
<p>If your software is a client application that will live locally on the user&#8217;s computer (think Microsoft Office or the latest version of Halo), you should very seriously consider creating an installer.  Back in the days of DOS and the Soviet Union the operating system was little more than a shell over a file system and the user had to explicitly go find and tell the computer to run your application.  Windows provides a start menu with a list of all the programs a user can run, and at a minimum you probably want to add entries so your users can easily find and run the software once it&#8217;s on their system.</p>
<p>On the other hand if your software is a web application then there probably isn&#8217;t going to be much benefit to creating an installer.  The installation is theoretically going to be done by a tech savvy individual that will be configuring the web server initially, and upgrades usually just mean copying newer files into the site directory.  The benefit of creating an installer for this process is rarely going to be exceed the cost.  This doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t /automate/ the upgrade process.  Most Headspring projects are configured to be deployed automatically by a continuous integration server to eliminate rote error prone activity, and very large web applications (think Netflix) usually are deployed by automatically creating a virtual machine image using tooling such as Puppet, Chef, or VMWare with the application.</p>
<h2>Why Should I Bother?</h2>
<p>Why should you go through the effort of creating an installer for your Windows client application?  Lots of developer tools are distributed as a zip file that contains the software, and it&#8217;s up to the person downloading it to place it on their file system somewhere and find it whenever they want to run it - what&#8217;s wrong with that?</p>
<p>Installers make software accessible to casual users who might not know what to do with a zip archive.  Even if the target demographic is power users, it still makes their life easier to provide them with an installer that adds start menu entries for them.</p>
<p>Installers also allow you to ensure that certain tasks or setup activities take place by running custom actions as part of the install, minimizing the chance your application gets configured incorrectly before your client starts using it.</p>
<p>There are other less tangible but still very real benefits as well.  An installer projects a professional image of your application.  This is your users first impression of your application, and having an installer silently says &#8220;this is a polished project&#8221;.</p>
