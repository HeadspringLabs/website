			Power to the Pinkies</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>By Casey Gum</em></p>
<p>As you may have gathered from <a title="Why try vi" href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/why-try-vi-part-1">my last post</a>, I am a big fan of vi/vim.  However, one thing that has always annoyed me about vi is that to get back into normal mode, you have to hit the escape key.  It is probably one of the most difficult keys to hit on the whole keyboard and many laptop keyboard layouts have made it about the size of peanut.</p>
<p>People who have been doing command-line linux for a long time don’t have a problem with this since environmental adaptation has elongated their left pinkies [citation needed].  People who use Windows and OSX, on the other hand, need help.</p>
<p>So, the natural thing to do is to commandeer the enormous and conveniently located Caps Lock key and make it act like the escape key.  (<strong>Note:  </strong>If you need to type OMG LOL ROFL, you can just hold down the shift key and type – you don’t actually need to use Caps Lock – just saying…)</p>

			HTML5 Boot Camp</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Headspring’s hands-on boot camps give participants the chance to take what they are learning and apply it in an existing application. Students will walk away from this course with working examples of how to get the most out of HTML5.</p>
<p><a href="http://headspring.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HTML5_Logo_256.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5550" title="HTML5_Logo_256" src="http://headspring.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HTML5_Logo_256.png" alt="" width="256" height="256" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Why Learn HTML5</strong></p>
<p>More and more, the development of business applications is shifting away from server-side due to the superior user experience and ease of coding that front-end development produces. Not only are managers expecting the use of these new technologies, but end users also want the same experience they get from using personal tools and software with those they interact with at work.</p>

<p><strong>Topics Covered Include:</strong></p>

		<p>When you define two methods with the same name in C#, they have to take in different argument types in order for them to be distinguished from each other.  Sometimes, I find myself wishing that you could also overload a method name when the inputs are the same, but return types differ.</p>
<p>Technically, you can&#8217;t do that in C#, but you can fake it.

<p><strong><em></em></strong>Austin, TX – June 07, 2012, Austin-based Headspring, a custom application development and consulting firm, today announced it has been recognized as one of the Austin Business Journal’s “Best Places to Work” in Central Texas.  Headspring ranked number four in the Small Companies category of the 2012 list.</p>
<p>Headspring was chosen as one of the top-five Best Places to Work in Central Texas after a series of voluntary employee surveys which examined climate, team atmosphere, benefits and employee engagement. <img title="More..." src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>“It is such an honor to be named one of the 2012 Best Places to Work in Austin,” says CEO/Founder Dustin Wells. “Austin is a rapidly growing city with an expansive job market; job seekers have a lot of options. We are really touched by the fact our talented team of employees choose to work here and evangelize on behalf of our unique culture.”</p>
<p>Award recipients were announced at a Hollywood-themed luncheon and ceremony on June 6<sup>th</sup> at the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center. The ceremony presentation included pictures and videos submitted by Headspring employees as a testament to their enthusiasm for the award-winning culture and work environment.</p>
<p>This award comes on the heels of Headspring’s announcement earlier this year to hire two new employees per month in 2012 and to promote the existing twenty-five employees within the company. Headspring is experiencing rapid growth and is set to triple the office’s square footage by moving into the Avalon Building, located in northwest Austin, at the end of July.  As Headspring continues to contract new and larger projects, they vow to preserve a fun and collaborative culture, while planning to hire two new employees per month in 2012.</p>

			Why Try Vi? (Part 1)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Like most people, the majority of my time on a computer has been spent on systems having an O/S with a graphical user interface.  Because I was not raised in the arcane dungeons of the command-line interface, I never [thought I] had any reason to learn to use vi.</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know what vi is, it is a powerful text editor that is built in to pretty much every Unix/Linux-based operating system on the planet.  Even present-day Macs have vi and you can access it from the terminal.</p>
<p>Having watched a proficient Linux user use vi a few times, I concluded that it was originally designed for programmer prisoners of war whose wrists were rigidly shackled to the bases of their keyboards and were therefore unable to reach either the mouse or the arrow keys. And for good measure, were punished for venturing too far from the home row.  I, a free, and enlightened programmer certainly had no use for this nonsense.</p>
<p>Then one day about 4 or 5 years ago, during a .Net boot camp given by <a href="http://blog.developwithpassion.com/">JP Boodhoo</a>, it was revealed to me the true power of vi.  JP coded and refactored so quickly, so effortlessly, it was almost impossible to track what he was doing – and he did this without ever having his hands leave the keyboard.  What was his secret?  It was <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> and <a href="http://www.viemu.com/">ViEmu</a>.
