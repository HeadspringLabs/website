		<p>I freely admit it – I have very little talent for creating images. So when I recently needed to add an icon to a website for users to download files, I dreaded the thought of having to create a picture of a download arrow.  Then I remembered that Visual Studio comes with images that can be freely used in your applications!</p>
<p>The image library is installed with Visual Studio, but you’ll have to extract the contents yourself.  Look in C:Program Files (x86)Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0Common7VS2010ImageLibrary1033 (or just “Program Files” if you still have a 32bit machine) and you’ll find VS2010ImageLibrary.zip.</p>

		<p><em>Dustin Wells shares his story of success in podcast series, The Eventual Millionaire</em></p>
<p><strong>Austin, Texas - May 2012</strong> - The Eventual Millionaire podcast series has released a recorded interview of Founder/CEO Dustin Wells sharing the story of his success in the custom software industry.  The interview explores his entry into entrepreneurship, personal struggles and triumphs along the way.  It also features insight into the daily operations of Headspring, Wells&#8217; leadership goals, and future plans for the company&#8217;s continued growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Eventual Millionaire is a great resource for people early in the process of building a business,&#8221; said Dustin Wells.  &#8221;I feel privileged to have been chosen to serve as a reference for those who are looking to grow their career.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Eventual Millionaire podcast series, led by Jaime Tardy, features weekly interviews of individuals with a net worth of $1 million who have built their own businesses. Previously interviewed entrepreneurs include best-selling author and Apple evangelist, Guy Kawaski, and Derek Sivers, Founder of CD Baby.  The series has been featured on media channels such as CNN, MSNMoney, Fortune.com, and Success Magazine.</p>

			Delegate Frustration</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the things I like about C#&#8217;s delegate types, compared to similar concepts in other languages, is that C#&#8217;s take on the concept lets you give a useful <em>name</em> to a family of functions:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2582885.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>With this definition, all functions that turn one thing into another thing are Converters.  Nice.</p>
<p>We also have some generically-named <code>Action&lt;…&gt;</code> and <code>Func&lt;…&gt;</code> delegate types defined for us, and these have become ubiquitous ever since LINQ was introduced.  They&#8217;re not as communicative, but still extremely useful, and for the most part the naming stays out of the way.</p>
<p>Delegate types allow you to give a name to a family of functions.  However, you can run into trouble when you use two different names to refer to the <em>same</em> family of functions:</p>

			Another Tiny Contribution to WebApiContrib</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have the privilege of working with lots of smart people. Sometimes they blog about things that are new, weird, wrong or backwards. <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/">Jimmy Bogard</a> posted something the other day that, to me, was weird. If you’re bringing <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a> into an existing ASP.NET web site or application, you probably want your API custom errors to match your web app’s custom errors. By default, this isn’t hooked up out of the box. In Jimmy’s post on <a href="http://lostechies.com/">Los Techies</a>, you’ll notice how he solves this problem.</p>
<h3><strong>What is ASP.NET Web API?</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve worked with ASP.NET’s take on HTTP for quite some time, but I&#8217;m usually the guy that avoids the past opinions of the Microsoft team. I feel like I understand how the web works and bulky .NET classes around it seem heavy handed and usually overkill; I try to avoid them at all costs. This is why ASP.NET Web API appeals to me. It’s a lighter-weight approach to the web with C# and the .NET stack. A few individuals have been paying attention to this for a few months now and I decided to help out a little bit after.

			Becoming a Headspringer: My First Week</a>
	</h2>

		<h2 dir="ltr">Welcome Number 7941</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d like for you to take a moment and imagine that today is your first day at a new company.  You enter the building wearing the carefully selected slacks and shirt ironed the night before.  You&#8217;re filled with nervous energy, but confident, because out of the fifty plus candidates, who did they select to write their new custom software solution?  That&#8217;s right, you.</p>
<p>The friendly HR rep that recruited you shakes your hand and leads you to a large conference room where you attend a new hire orientation.  You&#8217;re promptly handed an employee handbook the size of a telephone book and sit down.  Opening to a random page on Computer/IT Usage policies you learn that it&#8217;s against company policies to look at **cough** questionable **cough** images on company computers.  Interesting, you think to yourself, I figured that was common knowledge.</p>
<p>Over the next four hours you listen to HR representatives speak about company history, company policies, and benefits.  You fill out form after form of information asking for social security numbers, driver&#8217;s license number, passport number and other private information.  You&#8217;re handed a badge with an employee number, 7941.

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In a conversation about large software projects, the word &#8220;architecture&#8221; is bound to come up sooner or later.  Most programmers have a gut feeling for what this really means with regard to software, but if you asked 10 programmers to define it, you&#8217;d get 10 different answers.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf">Who Needs an Architect?</a>, Martin Fowler covers a few definitions which he ultimately boils down to one simple concept: <strong>architecture is the decisions that are hard to change.</strong></p>

			MVP vs MVC: Seeking Better Testability</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s something nice about returning to an old design pattern. Comparing it with the pattern you&#8217;re currently using gives you new insights about both.</p>
<p>When I was writing ASP.NET WebForms apps, my team organized the UI layer with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">MVP (Model View Presenter)</a> pattern, preferring the Passive View variant. This allowed us to write Views that were small and lean, pulling as much logic as possible out of that untestable wasteland of UI markup and code-behind. More recently, I&#8217;ve been developing ASP.NET MVC applications (using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC (Model View Controller)</a> pattern, naturally), and I like how my Views can be straightforward HTML with a few fill-in-the-blank spots for the data I want to display; much simpler to understand than the old WebForms server controls. But my most recent project, I wrote in <a href="http://windowsclient.net/wpf/">WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)</a> due to some specific needs of the client, and I had to re-open the UI design pattern question.

		<p>We have a lot of different options for data storage and retrieval available today. These options include the traditional relational database, document databases, key value stores, and even flat files. Every option has its benefits over the others, making some options better for some things and other options better for other things. Once the data storage and retrieval option is selected, we then typically have to select a product. Within a solution space, most products offer some distinction from their competitors. Such distinctions make certain products popular choices for a particular technology stack. For example, MySQL is a common choice for the LAMP stack, as is Microsoft SQL Server for the .NET stack.</p>
<p>Why is this so? There are several reasons for this, and their importance varies between administrators, developers, managers, and even executives.</p>
<p>From a developer&#8217;s point of view, it comes down to whether or not the product in the solution space makes the work more enjoyable.
