<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This post is a companion to the previous post in Part 5 - it shows and explains the structure of the WiX file that was used to generate the MSI.</p>
<h2>Tooling and References For Editing WiX Files</h2>
<p>Since the name of the toolkit is &#8220;Windows Installer in XML&#8221;, you probably won&#8217;t be terribly surprised to find out that the source files you edit are&#8230;wait for it&#8230;XML. This means you can author and edit in your favorite XML editor of choice, whether that&#8217;s Notepad++, some incredibly expensive specialty tool like Altova XML Spy, or Visual Studio. If you use Visual Studio and you&#8217;ve installed WiX on your local machine, you can leverage the included Votive project types to get Intellisense in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_6409&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;582&#8221;]<a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/votiveIntellisense.png"><img class=" wp-image-6409 " alt="Picture of editing with Visual Studio and Intellisense supplied by Votive" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/votiveIntellisense-970x562.png" width="582" height="337" /></a> Visual Studio Intellisense with Votive[/caption]</p>
<p>There&#8217;s reference documentation for the schema at <a href=" http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix3/schema_index.htm">SourceForge</a>. The first link is for the WiX schema itself, and there are other schema references for the various extensions that are available.</p>
<h2>The Complete Hello World</h2>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014691.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Dissecting the Elements</h2>
<p>Line 3 is pretty straightforward: declare our root Wix element and specify the namespace. No that isn&#8217;t a typo at the end; the namespace really doesn&#8217;t have an x at the end of it. I have no idea why.</p>
<p>Line 5 declares our Product for the installer (recall Product has a cardinality of 1). Some of the supporting attributes like Manufacturer, Name, and Version will show up in the Add Program and Features list for Windows.</p>
<p>Line 12 defines the Package (also cardinality of 1), which is the installer itself. Attributes here will show up in the properties of the MSI file.</p>
<p>Line 19 introduces the concept of Media, which wasn&#8217;t discussed in the MSI examination. Windows Installer has a profuse amount of options for the physical layout of the files to be deployed, including things like spanning multiple DVDs (or floppies - <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/231273/what-are-the-windows-a-and-b-drives-used-for">remember those?</a> The need for this has fallen by the wayside as most software is downloaded from the internet or an internal network these days. In this example, we only have one physical media target, and the EmbedCab attribute will package all the deployables into the MSI directly since we don&#8217;t need disc spanning.</p>
<p>Line 21 defines our target directory structure. Note it&#8217;s nested. I&#8217;m not going to discuss it exhaustively, but will point out a few interesting things. Line 22 specifies we&#8217;re installing into this machine&#8217;s Program Files directory, and line 23 is the INSTALLDIR, which is our root target directory. More sophisticated installers will allow the user to specify their own directory and replace the value of INSTALLDIR.</p>
<p>Line 24 defines our one and only component. Recall from the previous post its possible for a component to have more than one deployable in it, but there are advantages to having a component for every file. Components have a unique ID to identify them.</p>
<p>In this example we&#8217;ve associated our component with a target directory by simply nesting it under the desired directory. This works for simple scenarios, but if you have more than one target directory for your product or if your code generating your component definitions, it might be easier to declare the directory structure and components separately and use the DirectoryRef attribute on the component to make the association.</p>
<p>Line 25 contains a file that is part of this component. The name attribute is what the file will be called when it is placed on the target file system, and the source attribute specifies where to get the file when compiling the MSI package.</p>
<p>Line 26 does what you hopefully would guess; it removes the installation folder from the machine when the component &#8216;MainExecutable&#8217; gets uninstalled.</p>
<p>Line 32 finishes things out by declaring our single feature (although you&#8217;ll recall there could be multiple Features in a Product), and associating our component with it.</p>
<h2>Tying It All Together</h2>
<p>So we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>File HelloWorld.exe containing our executable</li>
<li>Component MainExecutable containing the HelloWorld.exe File</li>
<li>Directory INSTALLDIR (which itself is a subdirectory) associated with the MainExecutable Component</li>
<li>Feature called Complete containing the MainExecutable Component</li>
<li>Product that contains the Complete Feature (this is implied and doesn&#8217;t have to be explicitly defined)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this maps neatly to the MSI we took apart in the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/nolan/creating-windows-installers-with-the-wix-toolset-part-05/">last post</a>. In the next installment, we&#8217;ll look at the process for actually turning WiX into an MSI.</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Back in college, I stumbled across a great tool called <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>.  I used it to generate class diagrams from the source of a PHP application I was working on.  More recently, I&#8217;ve found it useful again for visualizing the <em>runtime</em> relationships between objects.  GraphViz can turn a plaintext description of relationships into a graph image.  Not &#8220;graph&#8221; as in &#8220;charts and graphs&#8221;, but &#8220;graph&#8221; as in &#8220;computer science graph&#8221;.  Nodes and edges:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/simple.png"><img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/simple.png" alt="simple" width="179" height="251" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6425" /></a></p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll see how to easily generate images like this.  Along the way, we&#8217;ll see an interesting use case for anonymous objects.</p>
<h2>The Dot File Format</h2>
<p>The image above can be generated from the following text file, using a GraphViz tool called dot.exe.  Note the use of the word &#8216;digraph&#8217;.  A graph is anything made up of nodes and edges; a digraph is a graph where the edges have <em>di</em>rection from a source node to a destination node.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014220.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>To create the image from the dot file, run the command: <code>dot.exe Simple.dot -Tpng -o Simple.png</code>.</p>
<p>The dot file format supports a lot of options.  For instance, we can customize the original dot file like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014224.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Optional attributes appear in square brackets.  Here, we give one of our edges a label, alter the colors, and change one of the nodes from an ellipse to a box:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fancy.png"><img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fancy.png" alt="fancy" width="179" height="275" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6424" /></a></p>
<p>One can imagine generating these dot files programmatically with a StringBuilder.  Doing so would be a little monotonous, especially when the optional attributes like shapes and colors are included.  You have to busy yourself with the dot format&#8217;s quoting rules as well as C#&#8217;s quoting rules.  Even when you succeed, you&#8217;ll be left with some ugly code.  I&#8217;d much rather generate the above two dot files like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014233.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014237.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Implementing the Digraph Class</h2>
<p>First, it&#8217;ll be handy to define an extension method to apply the dot quoting rules to any .NET value.  The double-quote character is special in dot files and must be preceded with a slash.  Of course, double-quotes and slashes are also meaningful in C# strings, so we have to double-escape these in the substitution:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014242.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Next, take a look at the way the optional parameters were supplied in the earlier code sample: <code>new { label = 1, color="red" }</code>.  This is an anonymous object.  It creates an instance of a class whose name we never see, with read-only properties named &#8220;label&#8221; and &#8220;color&#8221;.  We pass this to a method that doesn&#8217;t know what type is being passed to it, but that&#8217;s OK because we can use reflection to inspect such an object.  Here&#8217;s a helper that can look at these anonymous objects and turn them into an equivalent dictionary, whose ToString produces the dot syntax for attributes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014245.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> have instead provided a real named class with all the possible dot properties already defined.  Doing so would be useful as it would give the developer statement completion suggestions, but the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html">dot file format is actually quite extensive</a>.  In this case, it&#8217;s a very reasonable tradeoff to use anonymous objects and reflection for these node and edge attributes.  Even with statement completion, you&#8217;d find yourself frequently looking up details in the documentation anyway, so the return on investment would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>We can represent a single node in the graph like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014249.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>An Edge is defined by the two Nodes it connects:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014253.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Armed with all of the above classes, we can finally implement the Digraph class with ease:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014257.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Criticism</h2>
<p>Since the scope of this sample program is <em>entirely</em> devoted to generating the dot file format, I don&#8217;t mind the fact that I mixed state (node and edge definitions) with presentation (string formatting in each ToString override).  An earlier implementation put all of the string formatting in the Digraph class, but it was fairly ugly.  If the requirements expanded such that we needed to use the node/edge structure for things in addition to presentation in dot format, I would want to move all string formatting out of the Node, Edge, and Digraph classes, having a dedicated class just for traversing a Digraph to produce a dot file.</p>

</address>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This post discusses what an MSI is, We&#8217;ll use a Microsoft SDK tool called Orca to examine what the internal structure looks like.  We&#8217;ll also talk about how the internal structure maps to Windows Installer concepts.  While this post is not about WiX directly, authoring in WiX requires a good understanding of these internal structures and how they interconnect.</p>
<h2>The Contents of an MSI</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve installed several software applications like Office or Halo on your computer, chances are you&#8217;ve come across a file with type of MSI.  MSI stands for Microsoft Installer, and is the primary package type that Windows Installer consumes to install a product.</p>
<p>There are other file types used by Windows Installer, but MSI is the only &#8220;required&#8221; type for making an installer.  I&#8217;m not going to discuss the other types, but you can find out more about them <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa372842.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>For our dissection we&#8217;re going to use an MSI that installs a single file - HelloWorld.exe.  Here&#8217;s the installer:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/msi.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="msi" alt="msi" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/msi_thumb.png" width="244" height="83" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The installer has no user interface.  This is what happens when you double click the MSI to install it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installing.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="installing" alt="installing" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installing_thumb.png" width="244" height="94" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>What happens next is the window changes to say &#8220;Please wait while Windows configures Edgewolf HelloWorld&#8221; with a progess bar, and then performs the installation and closes.  This happens so fast I couldn&#8217;t get a screenshot of it before it disappeared.  After we run the installer, we have a new entry in Programs and Features that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/programsAndFeatures.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="programsAndFeatures" alt="programsAndFeatures" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/programsAndFeatures_thumb.png" width="244" height="58" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And we can find our installed program here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installed.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="installed" alt="installed" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installed_thumb.png" width="244" height="83" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t get much simpler then that, right?</p>
<h2>MSI Internal Structure</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting how trends in software development affect technical implementations.  For example, the programming language Java was rising to prominence around the same time the XML file format was being widely touted as THE way to store data for a variety of reasons.  As a result, Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE) relies heavily on XML files, to the point that I&#8217;ve heard jokes that enterprise Java development consists of writing one line of code and editing twenty XML files.</p>
<p>Windows Installer is no different, and its source of large inspiration is relational databases.  An msi package is, quite literally, a database file with tables and rows in it.  Here&#8217;s a partial schema diagram:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/payloadTables.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="payloadTables" alt="payloadTables" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/payloadTables_thumb.png" width="244" height="111" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Since an installer is for a single product, there&#8217;s dedicated table for that.  But a product like Microsoft Office does have multiple features such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  Large features will typically be composed of a collection of subfeatures that can be installed or not installed and still have a working feature.  Examples of subfeatures for Word would be items like spellcheck, or clipart.</p>
<p>Features and subfeatures are &#8220;above the water&#8221; concepts in the way that they are exposed directly to the person using the installer.  The user sees them and has a chance to choose what features they do or do not want.</p>
<p>Features are composed of one or more components.  Components are tangible items like files, start menu shortcuts, and registry entries.  Components are &#8220;below the water&#8221; in the sense that they aren&#8217;t meant to be exposed to users.  When you&#8217;re installing Word, you could care less that you&#8217;re getting the files winword.exe, wordcnv.dll, wordcnvpxy.cnv&#8230;.well you get the idea.  Components are linked to a directory where they are installed, and are composed of one or more files.  Because the directory link is at the component level, obviously all of the files in the component need to target the same directory.</p>
<p>Components are tied to features with a linking Feature Component table.</p>
<p>In addition to the payload tables we just looked at, an MSI also has sequence tables that instruct Windows Installer what steps to execute and in what order.  There are a number standard actions included in Windows Installer such as calculating the disk space needed to perform the installation.  It&#8217;s also possible to write your own custom actions, I plan on talking about that in a later post.</p>
<h2>Installing Orca</h2>
<p>Microsoft provides a free tool called Orca that can be used to examine an MSI file.  It isn&#8217;t part of Windows, but it&#8217;s included with the Windows 7 SDK.  You can get an ISO of the Windows 7 SDK <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442">here</a> and the Windows 8 SDK is available <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve installed the SDK, you can find an installer for Orca in the Bin directory (something similar to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin).  Run the installer, and then you&#8217;ll have Orca in your start menu.</p>
<h2>Examining the Hello World MSI</h2>
<p>Start Orca.  Click File..Open, and open the MSI you want to load.  Here’s what you’ll see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/msiTablesInOrca.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="msiTablesInOrca" alt="msiTablesInOrca" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/msiTablesInOrca_thumb.png" width="244" height="179" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to tables, the installer stores some nonrelational information in a Summary Stream.  You can view this by clicking &#8220;View..Summary Information&#8221;.  Most of it is product related, but the target architecture (32bit or 64bit) is also stored here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/summaryStreamInOrca.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="summaryStreamInOrca" alt="summaryStreamInOrca" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/summaryStreamInOrca_thumb.png" width="229" height="244" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Looking at the feature table, we see this installer only has one feature - Complete (as in a complete install).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFeature.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableFeature" alt="tableFeature" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFeature_thumb.png" width="244" height="53" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The FeatureComponent table links one component to our feature, the component called MainExecutable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFeatureComponent.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableFeatureComponent" alt="tableFeatureComponent" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFeatureComponent_thumb.png" width="244" height="75" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Heading over to the component table, we see MainExecutable, and it targets the INSTALLDIR for the directory.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableComponent.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableComponent" alt="tableComponent" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableComponent_thumb.png" width="244" height="54" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The INSTALLDIR is going into an Edgewolf HelloWorld subdirectory under Program Files.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableDirectory.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableDirectory" alt="tableDirectory" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableDirectory_thumb.png" width="244" height="71" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>So where&#8217;s the actual exe?  In the File table, and we see its linked to the MainExecutable component.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFile.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableFile" alt="tableFile" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFile_thumb.png" width="244" height="54" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t mention it earlier, but there&#8217;s also a Property table that&#8217;s a catch-all name value pair collection.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableProperty.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableProperty" alt="tableProperty" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableProperty_thumb.png" width="244" height="170" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The sequence tables instruct Windows Installer in what steps to take to run the installer.  Recall that there are two install stages (the UI stage and the Execution stage).  There are tables for each, and looking at the pictures below we can see the difference between the two:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installUiSequence.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="installUiSequence" alt="installUiSequence" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installUiSequence_thumb.png" width="244" height="115" border="0" /></a><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installExecuteSequence.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="installExecuteSequence" alt="installExecuteSequence" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installExecuteSequence_thumb.png" width="244" height="191" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough for this post.  Now we have a solid understanding of the basic building blocks in an installer package.  In the next post we&#8217;ll take a look at the WiX that generated this MSI.</p>

			Headspring Competes at 2013 Austin Startup Games</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Austin Startup Games were a flying success this past Saturday, February 16th at the Austin Music Hall. Headspring was proud to participate for the first time!</p>
<p>The Austin Startup Games is a one-day event in which sixteen Austin companies compete in various activities, including beer pong, ping pong, shuffleboard, foosball, pop-a-shot, darts, Connect 4, trivia and flip cup. The mechanical bull was the surprise event.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6417" alt="IMAGE_B2E4A8A6-E1D4-47B2-B540-53AA3B0AE653" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMAGE_B2E4A8A6-E1D4-47B2-B540-53AA3B0AE653-400x300.jpg" width="400" height="300" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6418" alt="IMAGE_E7ED9347-5418-44A0-B09F-55DEC43F43B8" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMAGE_E7ED9347-5418-44A0-B09F-55DEC43F43B8-400x300.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>We sported these awesome Headspring shirts. We call it &#8220;From Our Heads&#8221; because it&#8217;s an abstract mash-up of the Headspring culture. It combines what we do and tools we use (bit bucket, technology, code, the cloud, mobile apps) and the things we enjoy (bowling, the Internet, providing great customer service).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6414" alt="BDQfHQVCAAImy5p" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BDQfHQVCAAImy5p-369x300.jpeg" width="369" height="300" /></p>
<p>Each company represented a charity of its choice, and Headspring chose The Cancer Connection. (link: http://www.thecancerconnection.org/) The organization provides one-on-one mentoring and oncology and hospital support to patients. The Cancer Connection volunteers provide comfort, support and informational resources to cancer patients and their families.</p>
<p>There were very intense and close competitions, and at the end of the day, Headspring walked away victoriously with a couple of medals and a proud team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Justin P. won Bronze in Connect Four</li>
<li>Chris M. and Patrick M. won Silver in Beer Pong</li>
<li>Glenn B. and Kevin H. won Bronze in Foosball</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6415" alt="20130216_142241" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130216_142241-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6416" alt="732970388" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/732970388-225x300.jpeg" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>Total results:</p>
<ul>
<li>533 lbs (about 480 meals) of food was donated to Capital Area Food Bank</li>
<li>500-600 attendees was expected and actually had 800 attendees show up</li>
</ul>
<p>The Austin Startup Games was a great opportunity to bring out our competitive side, represent Headspring among numerous Austin companies, support The Cancer Connection and bring our team together for some fun and bonding time.</p>

			The Debugger Must Be Broken!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently, a coworker and I ran into one of those bugs that seem to behave so strangely that you start to wonder, &#8220;Is it me, or is the debugger itself buggy?&#8221;  It appeared that the simplest of operations, the assignment operator, was misbehaving.  In the debugger, we seemed to witness a value being properly set to a non-null object and then secretly nulled out as soon as we tried to look at it again.</p>
<p>Of course, whenever a program&#8217;s behavior is so profoundly counter to all that we know to be true, we have to stop, take a deep breath, and proudly exclaim, &#8220;I am making an incorrect assumption!  This code does not say what I think it says.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve boiled the problem down to a simpler form than the original code, and changed names to protect the guilty (me).</p>
<p>We had a collection of DTO instances, of a type we did not have control over (<code>StudentDTO</code>).  In the rest of our system, we wanted to use one of our own classes instead (<code>Student</code>), as <em>our</em> class implemented an interface that was consumed elsewhere (<code>Person</code>):</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4982706.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This first pass was bug-free, and the <code>ToPersons</code> method passed our unit test:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4982711.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Easy.  C# 101 stuff.  Of course it passed.</p>
<p>Some hours later, I had reason to convert <code>Person</code> from an interface to a concrete class:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4982716.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Suddenly, this and many other tests started failing.  <code>persons[0].Name</code> was null!  We set up a breakpoint on the return statement within <code>ToPersons</code>, and saw that each student being returned did in fact get populated correctly.  <strong>Surely, the debugger must be broken!  We clearly populate an object, and when we next look at it it is unpopulated!  Those punks at Microsoft really grind my gears.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ok, Patrick, take a step back.  What assumption is leading me to believe the debugger is wrong?</strong>  I&#8217;m claiming that a clearly-populated property is null the next time I look at it.  Therefore, I should start to doubt whether I am actually inspecting the same property both times.</p>
<p>In the debugger, we had already seen the <code>Student.Name</code> property set as expected.  We then went to the definition of the Name property that appears in our unit test assertion, which took us to <code>Person.Name</code>.  Here, we also saw a ReSharper warning on each property within <code>Student</code>.  We hadn&#8217;t even <em>changed</em> <code>Student</code>, but that is where the warning appeared: &#8220;The keyword &#8216;new&#8217; is required on &#8216;Name&#8217; because it hides property &#8216;Person.Name&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>This is one of those details you learn about C# early on and then immediately forget, as it so rarely shows up in practice.  Usually, when a subclass defines members with the same name and signature as its parent class, we are in a abstract/override or virtual/override situation, in which you are knowingly and explicitly stating that the subclass provides its own definition of the parent class&#8217;s behavior.  When a subclass instead defines the same members as its parent <em>without</em> overriding, you get <em>two</em> different implementations at runtime.  It&#8217;s basically just a <em>coincidence</em> that they have the same name.</p>
<p>In this situation, when you look at an instance through a variable declared as the parent type, you see the parent type&#8217;s properties.  When you look at an instance through a variable declared as the subtype, you see the subtype&#8217;s properties.  As we looked at the student variable being returned from the lambda, the debugger showed us the populated <code>Student.Name</code>, and when our test assertion looked at the person returned from the lambda, the test experienced the unpopulated <code>Parent.Name</code>.</p>
<p>When up is down, black is white, and the debugger stops working, put the apparently impossible behavior into plain English, and cast some healthy doubt on each word.  You&#8217;ve got a faulty assumption in there somewhere.</p>

			WCF IOC Away the Need for Named Pipes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The NetNamedPipeBinding is the optimized binding for on-machine communication.  For most WCF implementations I have seen WCF is really only there to help facilitate RPC (Remote Procedure Calls).  When WCF is simply a way to segment your service layer into an optionally distributed deployment architecture there may be a much better way.  WCF has additional overhead that seams useless if the code is being executed on the same machine.  IOC (Inversion of Control) using DI (Dependency Injection) provides a relatively simple way to avoid WCF all together.</p>
<p>Lets take a simple WCF Service Contract for Customers.<br />
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4945825.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>The client creates a proxy and through WCF configuration the proper binding can be used to communicate with the Service.  In order to make the client know where the service is without hardcoding this you would have the following configuration settings.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">  &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;system.serviceModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;bindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;basicHttpBinding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;binding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;BasicHttpBinding_ICustomerService&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;basicHttpBinding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;bindings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;endpoint&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;http://localhost:26859/CustomerService.svc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;binding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;basicHttpBinding&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;bindingConfiguration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;BasicHttpBinding_ICustomerService&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;contract&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;OptionalWCF.Contracts.ICustomerService&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;BasicHttpBinding_IUserProfileService&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;system.serviceModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<p>Most clients stop there rather than have a explicit setting for NetNamedPipes.  If they decided to “Optimize” they could add the WCF configuration endpoint for NetNamedPipes and modify the Service to expose a NetNamedPipe endpoint.  Now the client can use the NetNamedPipe endpoint and the performance has been improved.  In reality the performance between NetTcp and NetNamedPipe is rather minimal with a slighter advantage over BasicHttp.  The most optimal invocation is in-process so why not just go around WCF all together.  We already have the interface separation that DI can use and either way if we want optimal performance we will be tweaking configuration files for different deployment environments.</p>
<p>For this blog I choose StructureMap as my DI library.  My client Code only needs to get a handle to the interface.</p>
<div class="csharpcode">
<pre class="alt">var customerServices = ObjectFactory.GetInstance&amp;lt;ICustomerService&amp;gt;();</pre>
</div>
<p>The client is configured to either use WCF or use the direct reference to the service implementation of the service Contract.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;StructureMap&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;MementoStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;Attribute&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;rem&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- WCF Service Through Proxy --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;DefaultInstance&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;PluginType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;OptionalWCF.Contracts.ICustomerService, OptionalWCF&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;PluggedType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;OptionalWCF.Client.CustomerServiceProxyWrapper, OptionalWCF.Client&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;attr&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;=&quot;Singleton&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;rem&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--Real Service--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;rem&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&amp;lt;DefaultInstance&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;rem&quot;&gt;      PluginType=&quot;OptionalWCF.Contracts.ICustomerService, OptionalWCF&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;rem&quot;&gt;      PluggedType=&quot;OptionalWCF.ServiceImpl.CustomerService, OptionalWCF.ServiceImpl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;rem&quot;&gt;      Scope=&quot;Singleton&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;rem&quot;&gt;      /&amp;gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;StructureMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kwrd&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<p>Now if the client is running on the same machine WCF is discarded.  If the service is moved to another machine with a simple configuration file tweak WCF is used.  The clients code is none the wiser.</p>
<p>This pattern can be extending to support duplex communication by using .Net events instead of exposing the callback contracts to the clients.  I plan on writing an additional blog to cover this topic.</p>

			From Imperative to Declarative</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Two weeks ago, we took a peek at the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/whittling-parsley/">low-level pattern recognition classes</a> that make up the core of <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley">Parsley</a>.  Last week, we saw how pattern recognition involves 3 pivotal <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/composable-operations/">composable operations</a>: repetition, choice, and sequence.  We saw how Parsley implements basic repetition and choice operations, but sequence was still too hard to address.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll finally see how to extract a useful sequence operation into a useful class, finally giving us the last of the necessary composable operations, and freeing us to finish our high-level <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DSL</a>.</p>
<h2>Manual Sequence Recognition</h2>
<p>Recall the horrible imperative code necessary to recognize the trivial three-token sequence of [left-parenthesis, letter, right-parenthesis]:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4688927.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>To recognize a 3 token sequence, we need 3 nested if statements and 4 return statements.  To recognize an N token sequence, we need N nested if statements and N+1 returns.  Each if statement tests whether the last call to Parse(&#8230;) succeeded, and each if statement&#8217;s body hands off the remanining unparsed tokens to the next step.  Clearly, this does not scale well.</p>
<h2>(Ab)using LINQ</h2>
<p>Note how similar each step is: we always call Parse(&#8230;), then test for success, then pass the remaining unparsed tokens along.  The main thing that changes each time we dig deeper is the particular Parser object in play.  I&#8217;d rather just say &#8220;Require(LeftParen), then Require(Letter), then Require(RightParen), halting at the first point of failure&#8221;.</p>
<p>Our goal is to extract the &#8220;success check and unparsed token hand-off&#8221; action so that we don&#8217;t have to repeat it ourselves, and we want to do so in a way that lets us chain together any number of parsers representing a sequence of expectations, without having to indent deeper as the chain grows longer.  With no further ado, ParserQuery:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4802811.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>I apologize for this.</strong>  This was hands-down the most difficult 12 lines of code I have written or will ever write.  The pattern in play here is so difficult, so abstract, that <em>I don&#8217;t even know what to name some of the variables.</em></p>
<p>This is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wesdyer/archive/2008/01/11/the-marvels-of-monads.aspx">Monad</a> pattern.  It can be performed in any language that has lambda expressions in which the lambda body can refer to variables in the surrounding scope, like C#, Javascript, and Python, but is only ever used in practice when the language <em>also</em> has special syntax for its usages.  In C#, the special syntax which makes this pattern compelling is the <code>from/select</code> LINQ syntax.</p>
<p>This special syntax lets us &#8220;flatten&#8221; our nested if statements into a series of &#8216;from&#8217; clauses.  When using the complete Parsley DSL, we can rewrite IsParenthesizedLetter without any nesting:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4919965.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>ParserQuery defines some extension methods that are treated specially by the compiler.  Their existence allows us to select from Parser&lt;T&gt; objects instead of the usual ability to select from IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; objects.  Note how instead of having 3 nested if statements, we have 3 from clauses <em>in sequence</em>.</p>
<p>Note how the query does little more than <em>list</em> the 3 expectations in the order we expect them to appear in the input.  We &#8220;flattened&#8221; the nested if statements into a vertical series of from clauses.</p>
<p>Note also how this sequence operation is operating on 3 Parser&lt;Token&gt; objects (the right hand side of each from clause) and the type of the whole query is <em>also</em> a Parser&lt;Token&gt;.  Since our sequence operation results in the same type as it acts on, it is highly composable with last week&#8217;s repetition and choice operations.</p>
<p>Although complicated, there&#8217;s no magic here.  If we ask ReSharper to translate the above select statement into plain old method calls, we see that ParserQuery&#8217;s SelectMany method is being called N-1 times when there are N from clauses:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4942002.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In other words, our SelectMany method&#8217;s job is to hook a single from clause into the chain of execution.</p>
<p>C# rewrites a flat query into calls to the SelectMany extension method, which in turn does the success check and the passing along of remaining unparsed tokens, so all the same <em>work</em> is going on here as in the origial imperative code.  Thankfully, we&#8217;re no longer the ones doing that work!</p>
<p>Rather than trying to make sense of ParserQuery itself, it may be more illuminating to read <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley/blob/cb69098da8135f7ac5fb1b0f84071e0e8b94b8a0/src/Parsley.Test/ParserQueryTests.cs">ParserQuery&#8217;s unit tests</a>.</p>
<h2>So Where Are We?</h2>
<p>2 weeks back, we started with the low-level imperative classes.  These let us deliberately walk through the input, pattern matching as we go along.  It was annoying, but it worked.  Like assembly language, we wanted to instead work with a high-level alternative, even if the high-level alternative was ultimately doing this imperative stuff behind the scenes.</p>
<p>1 week back, we identified 3 fundamental operations necessary for a pattern recognition DSL: repetition, choice, and sequence.  We saw how repetition could be implemented as a class, ZeroOrMoreParser.  We saw how choice could be implemented as a class, ChoiceParser.</p>
<p>This week, we see that sequence can be handled by ParserQuery and the from/select keywords.</p>
<p><strong>Now, we have all the tools we need to finally create our DSL.</strong></p>
<h2>Assembling Parsley&#8217;s DSL</h2>
<p>Parsley deals with defining grammars for languages.  You could define a grammar for a language like JSON, and use that to turn JSON text into .NET objects.  Parsley contains a Grammar class full of useful operations.  To keep things highly-composable, many of these operations both produce Parser&lt;T&gt; objects and operate on other Parser&lt;T&gt; objects.</p>
<p>First, the Grammar class includes a few helper methods for constructing the classes developed last week:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4911336.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Next, we note that ZeroOrMore is useful, but not really enough in practice.  We may rather require that the input include OneOrMore occurrences of something.  Thankfully, we can <em>compose</em> sequence with ZeroOrMore to build OneOrMore.  OneOrMore things is the same as one thing followed by ZeroOrMore things:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4912909.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Where ZeroOrMore required a whole class full of imperative code, OneOrMore required <em>one 3-line expression</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also very common to expect the input to contain a repetition of items <em>separated by</em> some other expected thing.  A JSON array literal contains zero or more items <em>separated by</em> commas.  Here, the third operation, choice, makes an appearance.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4914803.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Finally, a little payoff for all this infrastructure!  Imagine how horrifyingly verbose and error-prone these methods would be, if we had to implement them directly in terms of the low-level imperative style.</p>
<p>Lastly, there&#8217;s one more built-in operation worth discussing as it directly affects the IsParenthesizedLetter method from the start of this post.  We often need to recognize that something important appears <em>between</em> two other, less important things.  A JSON array is zero or more items <em>between</em> the &#8220;[&#8221; and &#8220;]&#8221; symbols.  We care that the &#8220;[&#8221; and &#8220;]&#8221; are present, but the meaningful data we want to extract from that is the part in the middle:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4916812.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Revisiting the Original Example</h2>
<p>Now, in order to recognize a parenthesized letter, all we need is:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4923462.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Here, parenthesizedLetter is an object which can be handed the raw input tokens and can reply with one of two statements: &#8220;The input is not a parenthesized letter and here is why,&#8221; or &#8220;The input is a parenthesized letter and here is that letter.&#8221;  No nested if statements, no explicit progress through the token stream, no manual error checks at every step.</p>
<p>Most importantly, this says <em>what</em> it does rather than <em>how</em>.  <strong>We&#8217;ve turned our imperative API into a declarative API by repeatedly extracting common and monotonous patterns into highly-composable operations, and by further hiding those helper classes behind a few simply-named helper methods.</strong></p>

			Composable Operations</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week, we took a peek at the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/whittling-parsley/">low-level pattern recognition classes</a> that make up the core of Parsley.  The final example showed how you can walk through some untrustworthy text in small and deliberate steps, looking for expected input along the way.  At each step, the step either succeeds or fails.  On success, the remaining unparsed text is passed along to the next step.</p>
<p>This process was the epitome of imperative coding: <em>Do this, and then do this, and then do that.</em>  Despite this imperative core, I&#8217;d describe the intended usage of Parsley as declarative: <em>Here&#8217;s what valid input looks like, figure out the details for me.</em></p>
<p>I said I&#8217;d reveal this week how this shift from low-level imperative coding to high-level declarative coding can be implemented, but I&#8217;ve decided to split it into two posts.  This week, we&#8217;ll see how Parsley builds on the frustrating foundation by baking in a few fundamental and composable imperative operations.  Next week, we&#8217;ll see how that more-useful layer can be extended into a high-level <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">Domain Specific Language</a> (DSL).</p>
<p><strong>A declarative API needs to give your end users a suite of useful and familiar words, in such a way that the words can be easily combined to form larger declarations.</strong>  We&#8217;re going to take some important imperative operations, give them useful names, and package them up in such a way that they will compose well with each other.</p>
<h2>Pattern Recognition Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Parsley can recognize patterns not unlike those recognized by regexes.  When working with regexes, we&#8217;re constantly composing three fundamental operations: repetition, choice, and sequence.</p>
<p>With <strong>repetition</strong>, we say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got this regex here, and I want it to be repeated.&#8221;  The regex &#8220;A&#8221; recognizes a single letter &#8220;A&#8221;, and we can produce a more interesting regex &#8220;A*&#8221; to recognize zero-or-more As, or &#8220;A+&#8221; to recognize one-or-more As.  A more complex pattern like &#8220;(A+B+)&#8221; can likewise be made more interesting via repetition: &#8220;(A+B+)*&#8221; which recognizes zero-or-more occurrences of As-followed-by-Bs.</p>
<p>With <strong>choice</strong>, we can combine some small patterns into a larger one by saying, &#8220;Any one of these subpatterns could happen next.&#8221;  The regex &#8220;A|B&#8221; recognizes either an &#8220;A&#8221; or a &#8220;B&#8221;.</p>
<p>With <strong>sequence</strong>, we can combine some small patterns into a larger one by saying, &#8220;The first pattern, followed by the second, followed by the third.&#8221;  Regexes achieve this by just squishing them together in order: the regex &#8220;ABC&#8221; recognizes an A, followed by a B, followed by a C.  They all have to appear, and in that order.</p>
<p>These three operations <em>compose</em> very well.  The regex @&#8221;[_a-zA-Z]+[_a-zA-Z0-9]*&#8221; recognizes variable names.  We have repetition: the pattern has one-or-more leading characters and zero-or-more trailing characters.  We have choice: each character is an underscore or a letter or a digit.  We have sequence: to enforce that names don&#8217;t start with a digit, we have a two-part sequence of leading characters <em>followed by</em> trailing characters.  We say these operations &#8220;compose well&#8221; because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can be applied to any pattern.</li>
<li>Doing so takes very little code.</li>
<li>Most importantly, <strong>the result is also a pattern to which the operations can be applied again.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If our API can exhibit these three properties, we can say it is &#8220;highly composable&#8221;, which should go a long way to making the API declarative as well.  Instead of telling the machine what to do, step by step, we&#8217;ll just glue together a bunch of small words into a larger statement.  The small words and the glue operations we perform on them will hide all the imperative details.</p>
<h2>What Hurt Last Week</h2>
<p>The big example at the end of the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/whittling-parsley/">last post</a> just had to tell the user whether or not a string was a single letter surrounded by parentheses.  Despite being a simple pattern, the code involved was quite large and annoying to write.</p>
<p>Recall the Parser&lt;T&gt; interface:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4727988.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>A Parser of Things consumes some input tokens with the intent to construct a Thing.  On success, the Parser of Things produces a Thing and a reference to the remaining unconsumed tokens.  On failure, you get an error instead of a Thing.</p>
<p>To write the Parser of Parenthesized Letters, we first needed to write an implementation of this interface, just so that we could say &#8220;I expect the next token to be of a certain kind, would you kindly try to consume one such token?&#8221;  We then made a convenience method to construct instances of this class, to save on keystrokes later.  Finally, we could write the big, ugly Parser of Parenthesized Letters.</p>
<p>It hurts to have to write so much for so little gain.  I&#8217;d rather Parsley contain a suite of useful Parser&lt;T&gt; implementations out of the box, so I could just dive in and focus on detecting the pattern I&#8217;m interested in.  This suite of useful Parser&lt;T&gt; implementations ought to include our 3 fundamental/composable pattern-recognition operations: repetition, choice, and sequence.</p>
<p>First, though, the suite should provide some primitive operations to get started with.  Compared to our regex examples, we need to be able to express things like &#8220;A&#8221; before we can augment them into interesting patterns like &#8220;A*&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Parsley&#8217;s Default Parsers</h2>
<p>The default parser implementations are as frustrating to write as the sample from last week, since they are written in terms of the awkward low-level API.  However, they make things easier on the end user, as we&#8217;ll see next week.  They are found under the <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley/tree/cb69098da8135f7ac5fb1b0f84071e0e8b94b8a0/src/Parsley/Primitives">Primitives</a> folder.  Four of these are relevant to today&#8217;s discussion:</p>
<p><strong>TokenByKindParser</strong> - Last week we wrote a parser that takes an expected token <em>kind</em> and demands that the next token in the input be of that kind.  On success, the token is consumed.  For instance, if you are parsing C# you may reach a point where you expect the next token to be an identifier.  You don&#8217;t care what specific identifier it is, only that it is an identifier as opposed to an operator or number.  The real implementation of that class in Parsley is called TokenByKindParser:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4728010.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>TokenByLiteralParser</strong> - Sometimes you have a more specific expectation of what will appear next in the input.  Rather than only caring about what kind of token appears next, you&#8217;ll expect that the token will be a specific known string.  When parsing C#, you may reach a point where you know the next token must be a &#8220;;&#8221; character.  TokenByLiteralParser serves this purpose.  As with TokenByKindParser, we simply inspect the current token and return success or failure, advancing one token on success:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4728017.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>ZeroOrMoreParser</strong> - This class gives us our much-needed repetition operation.  Note that this class is constructed <em>with another Parser&lt;T&gt;</em> to be augmented, just as the regex &#8220;A&#8221; augmented by &#8220;*&#8221; becomes the regex &#8220;A*&#8221;.  The parser works by attempting the given parser against the input.  On success, we repeat from the new position in the input, collecting each intermediate result into a list.  As soon as the item-parser finally fails, we are finished and can return a successful result containing all the items collected along the way.  Note that this is a Parser&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt;, meaning that after consuming a bunch of tokens, the result you get is a collection of things, where each thing was recognized by the initial input Parser&lt;T&gt;.  That&#8217;s our first hint at composabilty:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4728052.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>ChoiceParser</strong> - This beast gives us our much-needed choice operation.  When we want the next thing in the input to be one of several possible things, and each of those things is individually recognized by a different Parser class, this combines them into one operation that says &#8220;Any of these things could appear next.&#8221;  The first one to match the input wins:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4728061.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>ZeroOrMoreParser and ChoiceParser make up a part of the composability we are shooting for here.  They take in Parsers as their input and are themselves Parsers.  That means you could feed one into the other: you might have two ZeroOrMoreParser instances, and pass them into a ChoiceParser: I expect zero-or-more As or else I expect zero-or-more Bs.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a subtle gotcha within both ZeroOrMoreParser and ChoiceParser.  By default, Parsley distinguishes between a parser that fails <strong>without</strong> advancing in the input and a parser that fails <strong>after</strong> advancing in the input.  If you are parsing C# and you know that the next thing in the input is a choice between a foreach statement or an if statement, but the input is &#8220;if $typo$&#8221;, we don&#8217;t just want to say that the choice failed; we want to say that your if statement is broken.  This is why these two classes care so much about detecting changes in position along the way.</p>
<h2>What About Sequence?</h2>
<p>TokenByKindParser and TokenByLiteralParser give us our trivial starting point, like a regex that only recognizes a single letter &#8220;A&#8221;.  ZeroOrMoreParser gives us repetition.  ChoiceParser gives us choice.  We still don&#8217;t have a useful sequence operation to build on.  Our complicated example from last week is still complicated!</p>
<p>Recall my criticism from last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>[IsParenthesizedLetter] is nearly as tedious as writing assembly. Each time I wanted to progress a little further, I had to indent again and declare some new local variables. I had to carefully pass along the remaining unparsed tokens at each step, and I had to concern myself with failure at each step.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, this stuff motivates having lots of returns from a single function, making it extremely hard to break the function apart into smaller parts. <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/detect-reflect-decomplect/">Return statements are &#8220;Extract Method&#8221; fences.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With all the code we&#8217;ve seen so far, we&#8217;re stuck with implementing all sequence patterns in this way, producing a convoluted morass of nested if statements.  We don&#8217;t even have the option of Extract Method refactorings to ease the pain.  We&#8217;ve coded ourselves into a corner!</p>
<p>Fortunately, a little-used design pattern will save the day next week, allowing us to bottle up the subtle code duplication exhibited by last week&#8217;s manual attempt at a sequence operation.  Once we have sequencing down, all of these peices will start to fit together smoothly, and our end user will finally have that suite of useful composable words at their disposal.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Last week, we saw how Parsley represents progress through the input, and caught a glimpse of how a desired pattern can be recognized (or not) within that input.  The code to use those classes was verbose, ugly, and apparently refactor-proof.</p>
<p>To ease the pain, we&#8217;ve seen how a few composable operations could be provided on top of the original core classes, but we&#8217;re still left with the tricky situation of sequencing.  Next week, we&#8217;ll implement sequencing, completing our DSL and insulating the end user from having to work with the ugly core directly.</p>
