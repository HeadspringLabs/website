			Agile Best Practices*</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>* - Disclaimer: if you&#8217;re looking for a simple list of &#8220;You Must, You Must Not&#8221; rules, this isn&#8217;t it. And you should be wary of any list that claims to be that list. Read on for more details.</p>
<p>Agile is not about specific rules. It is about attitude - willingness to change, adapt, and continuously improve and expand. There is no clean-cut set of rules that make one an aglie developer- it is a craft and a way of thinking that must be practiced and honed. That is not to say there are not resources out there to put you on the right path- Headspring offers<a href="http://www.headspring.com/services/developer-training"> an agile boot camp</a> that shows what steps you can take to put the agile attitude into practice. But there is no easy list of things that one can do to be an agile developer- and the push to find this list of things can create what some call &#8220;Agile Theater.&#8221; This is where teams use the &#8220;right&#8221; names for meetings, and call it agile development, but don&#8217;t really change their old ways of thinking. This can actually be quite detrimental to a software development team, as the added semantics of agile just add more work without actually changing the way things are done on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The name agile implies something other than just raw speed-

			When to Use a Rhino Mock, and When Not To</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I sit down to write a unit test, my first step is to describe for myself, in English instead of code, what I intend to test. The words I choose give clues as to the structure of the test and the style: interaction-based versus state-based. I&#8217;ll describe an example below.</p>
<p>RhinoMocks, and other mocking frameworks like Moq and TypeMock, are a support structure that let you write briefer, more expressive unit tests. RhinoMocks simplifies the quick creation of fake classes that your class under test relies on and interacts with. You can use those fakes for both styles of tests; RhinoMocks can make assertions about interactions in interaction-based tests, and it can provide non-exception-throwing behavior when you just need a stand-in for your state-based tests. I listen to the language of my description to know how I want to use that Rhino Mock.</p>
<p>For example, your application might have an EmailDispatcher that decides which emails to send, then calls an EmailService to send the emails. You&#8217;d like to unit test the logic in the EmailDispatcher without sending thousands of real emails. This is a perfect scenario for RhinoMocks.

			Powershell and Calling External Executables</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In my last post on <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/08/avoiding-on-error-resume-next-when-using-powershell">error handling when using Powershell</a>, we saw how Powershell&#8217;s default behavior for uncaught exceptions allows the rest of your script to continue running in a likely-invalid state, and how setting <strong>$global:ErrorActionPreference = &#8220;Stop&#8221;</strong> changes that behavior to stop as soon as an uncaught exception surfaces.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can <em>still</em> be surprised by Powershell&#8217;s error handling behavior. There are two main categories of errors your Powershell script might encounter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncaught exceptions thrown by your Powershell process.</li>
<li>Failure exit codes returned by external programs that your Powershell process invoked.

			Unit Testing Best Practices: Know Your Test&#8217;s Lifecycle, Part 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A long time ago, my development team decided to write our own unit test framework. Today that would be ridiculous, because there are so many mature options from the .NET community (NUnit, MbUnit, xUnit, MsTest, to name a few). But this was 2002, .NET was brand new, and we thought attribute-based metadata was a better approach to describing tests than the interface-and-naming-convention pattern that NUnit required at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, about the same time we&#8217;d gotten our homegrown framework running and built a couple thousand tests with it, NUnit 2.0 came out with a brand-new and shiny attribute-based metadata approach. We spent the next 3 years wishing we had the time to port all our tests to NUnit, and stealing features from it for our custom test runner.

		<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/07/powershell-and-the-principle-of-most-astonishment">Powershell and the Principle of Most Astonishment</a>, I covered some of the surprises that new Powershell users encounter when trying to reliably return results from functions. The next area where Powershell suprises new users is in its approach to error handling. Fortunately, there are some useful workarounds for making the surprising default behavior work more like you would expect.</p>
<p>While learning Powershell, I was trying to create a deployment script. The script needed to perform several tasks including, copying the deployment package to the target machine, setting up services, and the like. While testing it out locally,

			Two Reasons to Use Abstract Classes in C#</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Do you find yourself writing the same methods over and over in different classes? Say your project needs both a &#8220;Dog&#8221; class and a &#8220;Cat&#8221; class &#8211; do you end up writing a &#8220;sleep&#8221; method for both? What if, in two months, the client needs you to add a &#8220;possum&#8221; to the system? Do you end up going in and retyping &#8220;sleep&#8221; instructions yet again? When you&#8217;re modeling a system with many similar parts, it takes way too much time and effort to keep duplicating code for each class. Imagine how hard it would be to maintain a large project with thousands of classes! Besides, it violates the DRY principle of good programming: Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself! There must be a better way.

			True Confessions, Public Shaming, and Test-Driven Development</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Okay, I admit it. Sometimes I write unit tests second instead of first. I also bite my nails and rest my elbows on the dinner table. But when I&#8217;ve got a bug to fix, and I&#8217;ve already found the offending line, I can hardly resist the urge to just&#8230; just&#8230; <em>change</em> it. I&#8217;ll follow up with unit tests afterwards, promise.</p>
<p>I admit this to you because admitting my wrongs is a step towards rehabilitation. I admit this to save you pain. Learn from my example. Test-second is so much less efficient than test-first. Consider the following workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reproduce, identify, debug the issue.</li>
<li>Fix the code.</li>
<li>Compile and try it out.</li>
<li>Write a test that proves I fixed it.</li>
<li>Compile and run the test.</li>
<li>Change the code back to make sure my test really proves what it is trying to prove.</li>
<li>Compile and see the test fail.</li>
<li>Re-fix the code.</li>
<li>Compile and see the test pass.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I humble myself before you. How much time am I wasting there? It&#8217;s embarrassing.
