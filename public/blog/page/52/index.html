			You Could Have Invented Lambda Expressions</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Delegate types and lambda expressions have been a part of the .NET tool belt for a while now, so they show up everywhere. If you&#8217;ve ever used StructureMap, AutoMapper, ASP.NET MVC and the like, then you&#8217;ve surely run into them. Despite this, delegates and lambdas tend to confuse developers when first encountered. Even when you get comfortable with the syntax as it&#8217;s used in your favorite library, you might not really be familiar with what they <em>are</em> or how they allow for such seemingly magical statements.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pretend that delegate types and lambdas don&#8217;t exist yet, and then reinvent them in terms of other .NET concepts that are more widely understood.</p>
<p>Suppose we have been given an IEnumerable&lt;Customer&gt; and we want to filter that down to the list of those customers who live in Texas. Without delegates, we could write the obvious loop like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1253799.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Yeesh. I have written foreach-if-add loops a thousand times. Whenever we find ourselves writing virtually the same thing again and again, we should take a step back and think, &#8220;Is there a deeper concept here I could pull out into a library?&#8221; We have some subtle code duplication whenever we write foreach-if-add loops.</p>
<p>To remove duplication, we first identify what parts vary from one instance of the pattern to the next. For foreach-if-add loops, the things that vary are the type of the items being filtered, and the if-statement&#8217;s condition expression. To bottle up the foreach-if-add loop, we need a new method that takes in the condition as an <em>argument</em>. Without delegates, we could deal with this using an interface:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1253795.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Ok, so we&#8217;ve pulled out the foreach-if-add loop into a reusable <code>Where</code> extension method. Still, though, that&#8217;s a lot of boilerplate code: every time we want to call <code>Where</code> with a new filter, we have to bottle it up in a whole new class.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start removing boilerplate code until we&#8217;re left with delegates! With this example, we can <strong>imagine a whole family of interfaces that have one thing in common: interfaces with a single method named <code>RunMe</code>, whose implementing classes contain only that method.</strong> If we knew this family of interfaces only have one method, and its name was always <code>RunMe</code>, then we could avoid even writing its name: <code>condition.RunMe(item)</code> could be shortened to simply <code>condition(item)</code>. Since the relevant part of a single <code>IFilterCondition</code> implementation is the body of the now-nameless method, we should be able to simply provide the code for that method inline:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1253808.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>We can imagine that this use of the <code>delegate</code> keyword is just shorthand for an instance of a class implementing our single-method interface.</strong></p>
<p>Since most of these small unnamed classes exist just to evaluate and return a single expression, we might as well get rid of the <code>return</code> keyword and braces. Since we already know what the item type T is, we might as well leave out the type declaration of the <code>customer</code> parameter, allowing the compiler to fill in the blank. We&#8217;ll need <em>something</em> between the argument list and the return expression so the compiler knows which is which, so we introduce the =&gt; operator. This makes the <code>delegate</code> keyword redundant, leaving us with some valid (and clean!) C#:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1253881.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to delegates and lamda expressions, but in most cases I find it easiest to reason about them as shorthand for the interfaces and classes we would have otherwise used.</p>

			Crafting an Extensible Reporting Schema</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Traditional relational database schemas are designed to keep computers happy. Indexes, foreign keys, joins&#8230;all of these tools allow for the highest level of optimization so data can be recorded and read back in record time. However, humans are typically very <em>un</em>happy when it comes time to answer business questions from this data.</p>
<p>Imagine your boss approaches you and asks for a report of all orders placed by the Acme Corporation on Thursdays. You recall how many times you and your team optimized the database containing this information so data could be written at break-neck speeds and moan when you think of the complex script you&#8217;ll need to write to retrieve the report your boss requires. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if, instead of lines and lines of arcane SQL, we could ask a database something like the following and get back exactly what we expect?</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt; select * from Orders where Customer = &#39;Acme&#39; and DayOfWeek = &#39;Thursday&#39;&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>No joins, no convoluted date parsing&#8230;in fact, this SQL statement is almost identical to the sentence your boss used, isn&#8217;t it? How do we get to this level of utopian question-answering? The key is in the concept of &#8220;complex writes and simple reads&#8221;: instead of saving data to a database only in some crazy &#8220;normal form&#8221; fashion, flatten out your data so you can more easily query against it. Let&#8217;s take a look at a simple date&#8230;say, my birthday this year: 13 December 2011 2:18 PM.</p>
<p>Normally, we&#8217;d stick this value into a column designed for holding dates&#8230;and that&#8217;s fine, assuming the only question we&#8217;ll ever want to ask is &#8220;show me something that occurred on 13 December 2011 at 2:18 PM&#8221;. Unfortunately, that sort of question almost never gets asked. Instead, it&#8217;s queries like &#8220;on Tuesdays&#8221; or &#8220;in the afternoon&#8221;. To answer these questions, our schema needs to be modified a bit. The original &#8220;date-only&#8221; schema might look something like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt; OrderDate : datetime&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>After we flatten out the date and time, our schema might look something like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt; Day : int Month : nvarchar Year : int DayOfWeek : nvarchar Hour : int Minute : int PM : bit&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>Given this schema, we can now ask a multitude of questions about the single record represented, such as:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 1.0em;">
<li>How many orders were placed in January?
<pre>&lt;code&gt; select count(1) from Orders where Month = &#39;January&#39;&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>What orders did Acme place on Friday afternoons?
<pre>&lt;code&gt; select * from Orders where DayOfWeek = &#39;Friday&#39; and PM = &#39;1&#39;&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting data into this type of schema is actually surprisingly easy; in fact, each of these values can be extracted from a single .NET DateTime object:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt; var timsBirthday = DateTime.Parse(&quot;13 December 2011 2:18 PM&quot;); var day = timsBirthday.Day; var month = timsBirthday.ToString(&quot;MMMM&quot;); var year = timsBirthday.Year; var dayOfWeek = timsBirthday.DayOfWeek; var hour = timsBirthday.Hour; var minute = timsBirthday.Minute; var pm = timsBirthday.Hour &amp;gt;= 12;&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s not just dates that can be flattened out in this manner! For a hypothetical generic Customer object, for example, you can extrapolate (and answer business questions on!) properties like these:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 1.0em;">
<li>Name</li>
<li>Primary Contact</li>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>City</li>
<li>State</li>
<li>ZIP Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy reporting!</p>

			What Can We Learn From Calvin & Hobbes?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A lot of people call me up when they need custom software to solve a problem. While each project is a little bit different, they typically fall within a few categories of maintainable software solutions. I’ve learned a valuable lesson about categories though: Sometimes you have to throw them out the window to clearly understand a problem…</p>
<p>Growing up I read a lot of Calvin and Hobbes. I’ve got every anthology including the leather-bound edition. As much as I love reading them, I find myself having to refocus halfway through a single strip. I tend to think that I know the ending to a given strip or series, and I skip ahead.</p>
<p>Oh, this is the one where he collects all the UPCs and gets a propeller beanie. I’m going to flip a few pages and see the look on his face when he doesn’t take off!</p>
<p>I always thought I had read every single Calvin and Hobbes. There was nothing about that kid and his tiger that I didn’t know.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, I was going back through my old collections and I found that I definitely hadn’t read every strip. In fact, I found that I had skipped most of the large Sunday illustrations because over the years I was skipping pages, thinking oh, I’ve read all of these storylines before.</p>
<p>It turns out those Sunday illustrations were the best. They were the ones that had cool stuff like T-Rex’s riding in fighter jets! (Spoiler alert for the shockingly Randy Quaid-less ending of Cowboys vs. Aliens).</p>
<p>I find that this same pattern shows up if I’m talking with a client who has a familiar problem. I have to focus myself on what they’re telling me so I don’t jump ahead in my mind to what I think the solution is. If I do that, I’ll miss out on all of the really important stuff they’re sharing- things that I wouldn’t have thought could be a part of the problem or answer. I want the Sunday edition of their story, I don’t want to hear the first panel and flip to my ending.</p>
<p>If a company is looking to become more agile, if they’re looking for an object-oriented development approach, or if they want us to modernize their legacy system, I have to put away my jump-to-conclusions mat- I might surprise myself and discover something I wouldn’t have found otherwise.</p>

			Headspring Sponsoring Open Source Hackathon</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In conjunction with <a href="http://lostechies.github.com/fiesta/">Pablo’s Fiesta</a>, an open-space development conference being held in Austin September 30-October 2, Headspring will be sponsoring an Open Source Hackathon at our offices on Sunday October 2nd from 1 PM to 6 PM. Over 150 developers from all over the United States and beyond are coming to Austin for 3 days of ‘sharpening the saw’, and the Los Techies Crew realized that with all that brainpower in one place, we ought to be able to do some concentrated work on the open source tools we all use so much.</p>
<p>If you’re attending the Fiesta, or even if you aren’t, feel free to come by the Headspring offices on Sunday to learn more about how open source software is written, ask questions about tools you’re using or would like to use, or even kick-start a new open-source project! Please bring a laptop if you can!</p>
<p>Get more details by going to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pablos-fiesta-hackathon?hl=en_US">Google Group for Pablo’s Fiesta Hackathon</a>.</p>

			Using jQuery in ASP.NET With IntelliSense Correctly</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I&#8217;m teaching the MVC boot camp, I&#8217;m always amazed at how some of the smallest things are most impressive to students. One of the most common &#8220;wow&#8221; moments I see from students not familiar with jQuery is how you can trick Visual Studio to provide IntelliSense by including the vsdoc file, but make sure it still uses the min file for performance. That can be done by including the vsdoc file in an if(false) condition like below. This ensures it will never get included in the production code, which still tricking visual studio&#8217;s tooling to import the IntelliSense.</p>
