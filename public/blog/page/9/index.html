			The Defensive ToArray</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/a-game-of-throws/">A Game of Throws</a>, we saw a frequently-blogged-about gotcha regarding the <code>yield</code> keyword and exception handling.  This week, we&#8217;ll see how there is more than one motivation for using the <code>yield</code> keyword, and when you opt into it for one you get the other whether you like it or not.  This leads to a code smell: littering our code with &#8216;defensive&#8217; calls to ToArray().

			A Game of Throws</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/infinite-laziness/">Infinite Laziness</a>, we saw how the <code>yield</code> keyword lets us work with <em>lazy evaluation</em>, in which work is deferred and performed on demand once something else actually needs to consume the result.  Lazy evaluation with <code>yield</code> isn&#8217;t free, though; it has some unfortunate consequences.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;ll see how lazy evaluation affects exception handling.  Next week, we&#8217;ll see how <code>yield</code> complects brevity with laziness, resulting in some undesirable patterns.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>With the release of ASP.NET MVC 4, we’ve updated <a title="MVC4 Boot Camp Curriculum" href="http://www.headspring.com/headspring/mvc-boot-camp/" target="_blank">our boot camp curriculum</a> to include the latest enhancements and features - the biggest of which is the inclusion of ASP.NET Web API. We’ll look at where Web API fits with modern web applications, and where we’ve seen Web API fit best.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC 4 also includes a number of mobile enhancements, AJAX improvements, bundling and minification, all of which will be covered in the course.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

			Bugs of Omission</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When your software includes faulty logic or conflicting requirements, you&#8217;re very likely to run into unexpected behavior.  These bugs are relatively easy to trigger and diagnose.</p>
<p>A bug of omission, on the other hand, in which you <em>should</em> have included code to cover an edge case, might sit around lurking for quite a while.  When such a bug finally does surface, the behavior may be so counter to your expectations  that you&#8217;ll wonder if maybe, just maybe, a rogue pixie or trickster demigod has cursed your machine.

			Low-Ceremony xUnit</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;High Ceremony&#8221; software includes excessive detail which distracts from the essential thing the coder is trying to convey.  In C# for instance, you could argue that having to place <em>all</em> methods inside classes is needless ceremony.  Your Main() method shouldn&#8217;t need that extra boilerplate, but we just Have To Do It That Way.  We have to perform that ceremony.  Developers who favor dynamic languages would find type declarations to be High Ceremony as well, and even C#ers admit this whenever they use the <code>var</code> or <code>dynamic</code> keywords.</p>
<p>High ceremony isn&#8217;t limited to language details, though.  We can be guilty of introducing it, ourselves.

			Seamless Audit Trails in RavenDB</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Since the basic product sold by software consultancies is consultant-time, you would expect there to be pressure (gentle or not), to put in as many billable hours as physically possible, to the detrement of quality.  Fortunately, Headspring takes the long view: excess hours this week may make this week&#8217;s revenue numbers jump, but sustainability matters more for all involved.  I first experienced this policy as a reliable 40 hour work week, but it doesn&#8217;t stop there.  When you take the long view, you respect the need to put some unbillable time towards improving your own skills.  This week, I got to take advantage of that flexibility by attending Headspring&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.headspring.com/events/ravendb-boot-camp/">RavenDB Boot Camp</a>, taught by <a href="http://coderwall.com/alonsorobles">Alonso Robles</a>.</p>
<p>When new software tools come around, they almost always claim to &#8220;Just Work&#8221;.  Even <a href="http://ravendb.net/">ravendb.net</a> makes this claim.  Real software problems tend to involve lots of competing concerns, so we should always take such claims with a grain of salt in addition to an open mind.  During the Boot Camp, I got to see a perfect example of where this &#8220;It Just Works&#8221; claim comes from.

We found him pretty much straight out of college, but his resume and <a href="http://loudandabrasive.com/">portfolio</a> showed a lot of potential.  We’ve never hired a fresh graduate before, but he’s proven to encompass every ounce of thoughtfulness, creativity and skill we have come to expect from a seasoned developer.  After a few weeks on the job, I’m convinced!</p>
<p>Patrick is a native Austinite, but graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in Game Design and Development. We’ll forgive him.
