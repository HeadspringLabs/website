			Get to Know a Developer: Alonso Robles</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/get-to-know-a-developer-alonso-robles/alonso-v1" rel="attachment wp-att-4177"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4177" title="Alonso v1" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Alonso-v1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Alonso Robles is our newest Principal Consultant at Headspring, and has quickly become an office favorite.  He is very enthusiastic about working here, and even <a href="http://alonsorobles.com/2012/03/14/joining-headspring/">wrote a blog</a> the other day expressing this sentiment.  But the thing I’ve noticed about Alonso is that he is enthusiastic about everything – his family, his projects, his clients.  He’s a refreshingly happy addition, and great for conversation.  Here was how ours went this morning:</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. I think everyone is an expert in something they just don’t know it. We all have things that we are really good at and things we are really passionate about. It’s those things that we are both really good and really passionate about that we typically experts in. My passions and experiences are with programming and developing back end systems – specifically distributed system integration and data persistence.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a long life story that starts from my early childhood. I can sum it up by saying I kind of fell into it as a result of necessity and luck.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>One of my earliest childhood memories involving computers was figuring out how to hack the dictionary file so I could beat an educational spelling game my father purchased for me in grade school on an IBM PS/2. I still remember the look in his face when I showed him I could beat the game by typing in gibberish on the keyboard. I also remember working the Logo programming language at my elementary school and programming a text based game in BASIC on that old IBM PS/2.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! I actually tutored math and science in high school. I think that may have been the first time I was in a real role with teaching capacity. I really enjoy speaking at user groups and helping my peers learn when I can. I sometimes find myself considering going back to school and working on a PhD so I may work as a professor.</p>
<p><strong>Where do begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>It just depends on the resources available and what is to be learned. I am constantly reading academic journals and blogs about topics I am interested in. When time permits I will go to a conference or convention. If I need to find more depth, I will usually grab a book and/or look for a training course. My favorite way to learn is to pair up with a peer or mentor and get my hands dirty by pair programming or drawing on whiteboard. I find a ton of value in interacting with an expert. Learning about the things they consider and think about while also getting familiar with the subject is indispensible in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>What does your team rely on you for?</strong></p>
<p>Developers do more than just code. They find creative solutions to both technical and human challenges and then translate those solutions to well crafted code. It really is in many ways more of art than a science. They rely on me to help them when they get stuck. I know I rely on them when I get stuck.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I gauge it by how much quality time I can spend away from work, especially with my wife and kids. If I can go home feeling proud about my day’s accomplishments with a clean conscience, then I can go home without worrying about work and focus on what matters most to me. That is “work time” well spent.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the future?</strong></p>
<p>At this point in my life I am pretty focused on raising my kids and getting them ready for life beyond the school years. After that, I am not really sure. Perhaps, I will go back to school and get that PhD. Or maybe just work towards retirement so I can enjoy more time with my family. I think I would like to travel with my wife a bit after the kids leave the nest. But those plans are still very fuzzy.</p>
<p>Look for Alonso on his <a href="http://alonsorobles.com/">blog</a>, which he updates regularly, or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/alonsorobles">@alonsorobles</a></p>
