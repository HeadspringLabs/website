			Mentorship and Pie Potential</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This past summer, the Headspring staff took a trip to <a href="http://www.k1speed.com/austin-location.html">K1 Speed</a> for a quarterly meeting.  When we weren&#8217;t &#8220;testing the safety equipment&#8221; around the track, we were talking about our performance for the quarter as well as plans for the future.  We were asked to imagine a much larger Headspring 1-2 years out, and describe what it would take to get there.</p>
<p>I shared a hard truth, suggesting we start considering more recent grads in our hiring process.  This may seem counter-intuitive.  Hiring talented folks for software development is extremely tough, and real-world experience matters a lot when evaluating candidates, right?  On the flip side, though, most experienced software developers have a long list of horror stories from past jobs: office politics, bureaucracy, teams spread too thin, death marches, and the like.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be great, for both you and the new hire, if they got to skip all that luck-of-the-draw stuff and instead got <em>all</em> of their real-world experience at a healthy company right from the start?</p>
<p>From a candidate&#8217;s point of view, they could enter the workforce surrounded by experienced people who have already faced and rejected all those problems.  They could learn from everyone&#8217;s example far more quickly than they would otherwise on their own, and they wouldn&#8217;t run the risk of being set <em>back</em> by the examples of struggling teams.</p>
<p>In reaction to my suggestion, I was asked to take on a mentorship role with a current student, with the goal of preparing him for an internship here at Headspring.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way things work here: if you make a suggestion to improve things, don&#8217;t be surprised if <em>you</em> get to make it a reality.  In light of this policy, next time I think I should share another hard truth with the team: <strong>we need to be eating more cakes and delicious pies</strong>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve only been meeting for a few weeks, but it&#8217;s already a rewarding experience for both of us.  Once per week and for about an hour, Dan and I meet to bring him up the C# / MVC learning curve.  When we first met at a <a href="http://www.polyglotprogrammers.org/">Polyglot</a> meeting, Dan had some experience with C++ and Lua, but hadn&#8217;t worked with C# yet.  Our initial meetings have focused on the nuts and bolts of C# itself, but even early on we got to cover other topics such as automated testing, readability concerns, the DRY principle, etc.</p>
<p>On the selfish side of the equation, this experience helps me to improve my own skills.  Having to explain things that I take for granted forces me to challenge my own assumptions, and improves my ability to discuss complex technical subjects with clients.  On more than one occasion, Dan&#8217;s questions have left me initially thinking to myself, &#8221;<em>Why</em> exactly, do I feel so strongly about this opinion?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have appreciated having a mentor at that age, but filling the opposite role is looking to be a pretty sweet deal.  Not as sweet as my cake/pie suggestion, but sweet nonetheless.</p>

			Jack Welch MBA Course: Business Communication and Ethics</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Earlier, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/jeffrey/jack-welch-mbaa-new-graduate/">I wrote</a> about my experience at the <a href="https://twitter.com/jack_welch"><a href="http://www.jwmi.com">Jack Welch Management Institute</a>.</a>&nbsp; One of the courses in the program is Business Communications and Ethics.&nbsp; In hindsight, it was very appropriate that this course be the very first course in the program.&nbsp; After an overview of communications and ethics, the course pressed two things very hard.</p>
<h2>Candor and differentiation</h2>
<p>Mr. Welch <a href="http://www.jwmi.com/content/business-communication-and-ethics-candor">contends</a> that “the biggest dirty little secret in business” is the absence of candor (Winning).&nbsp; The course teaches that so many problems rise out of the fear of honest communication.&nbsp; We are reminded that children are naturally candid and have no filter in what they say.&nbsp; It is through cultural conditioning that we learn to hold in what we are really thinking.&nbsp; In some organizations, the culture discourages real candor.&nbsp; Instead, saving face is valued more.</p>
<p>A key example of candor taught in this course relates to performance appraisals.&nbsp; Jack is famous for teaching a 20/70/10 differentiation method where management communicates to employees where they stand.&nbsp; This is most important for the bottom 10%.&nbsp; He contends that it is unfair to the employee to keep that honest feedback from those employees, who may spend more years at the company not understanding why they are not progressing in their careers.&nbsp; Instead, Jack contends that being candid with these employees, and helping them leave, is much more fair to them.&nbsp; The central idea in this is the belief that everyone is a star at the right company and the faster they realize the current company isn’t tapping their unique strengths, the sooner they can find the company and role that helps them shine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This method of candid performance communication drives a lot of controversy, but usually not from the top 20%.&nbsp; After this course, we slowly implemented this method at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a>, and I have to attest that it works.&nbsp; We do quarterly performance reviews, and we differentiate.&nbsp; Through some conference call questions with Mr. Welch during the program, students were able to ask him questions, and he clarified his method for smaller companies where the law of large numbers doesn’t yield a good 20/70/10 distribution.&nbsp; He said that the benefit is there as long as there is real differentiation.&nbsp; He coaches that management must be honest with itself and realize that not all employees are the same.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Ethics and managing a crisis</h2>
<p>After some academic reading on case studies involving corporate ethics, we were able to discuss a timely scandal.&nbsp; That was the scandal of BP and the communication method used after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP at the time, failed to get out ahead of the crisis.&nbsp; When a crisis happens, the curriculum teaches that leaders need to get out ahead of crisis communication and be the source of new information.&nbsp; Tony Hayward failed to do this.&nbsp; Because of it, news media filled the role of finding and communicating new pieces of information.&nbsp; When the news is coming from reporters, the revelations allude to a cover-up, where there is one or not.&nbsp; As a leader, claiming the role of briefer positions one as transparent.&nbsp; Regardless of mistakes made in a crisis, a worse mistake is not owning and leading crisis resolution.</p>
<p>You can read one of the <a href="http://www.jwmi.com/content/business-communication-and-ethics-candor">lectures of this course here</a>.</p>

		<p>We often think of bonding and rapport as something done with clients, but it’s just as valuable with your colleagues.  At Headspring, we believe it’s important to celebrate our successes and reenergize by bonding as a team.  We do this daily through teamwork, but every once in a while we simply need to have some fun together.  For our Q3 get together, we teamed up with City Sleuth, an expert city scavenger hunt company, to enjoy an afternoon of solving riddles and scavenging around downtown.  We sure got to know Austin really well!  In the end, we honored team members with awards, ate a great lunch, and created memories outside of the office environment.</p>

			Avoid Mutation by Default</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Several weeks back, I was <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/low-ceremony-xunit/">customizing xUnit</a> to cut down on ceremony in my tests.  When I ran into some trouble, I started looking through the source code for xUnit, and saw something a little surprising: tests within a test class are executed in a random order.  Sure, tests need to be isolated so that test execution order doesn&#8217;t affect their success or failure, but randomizing within the test runner seemed like overkill.</p>
<p>If it ever caught an issue, it still wouldn&#8217;t tell me where the problem was, right?  It seemed like it would be better to execute in a deterministic order so that when I <em>do</em> get myself into trouble, it will be reproducible trouble.  Today, though, I was grateful for this behavior.  If you&#8217;re running tests frequently during development, the very fact that your newly-coded tests start failing at random <strong>is</strong> informative: <em>&#8220;What test is wrong?  The one that I just wrote.&#8221;</em></p>
<h2>A Trivial Yet Broken Class</h2>
<p>I was working on a routine whose job was to produce a date range after taking into account several business rules.  If none of the rules applied, we wanted to return the range [DateTime.MinValue, DateTime.MaxValue] to indicate &#8220;all the dates we could ever possibly care about&#8221;.  Each business rule could possibly shorten this range, affecting the start, the end, or both.  The overall result was, basically, the range where several other ranges overlapped.  I started by creating a helper class, DateRange, as a glorified pair of DateTimes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3949963.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>To make it clear to the reader that we were starting with &#8220;all the dates we could ever possibly care about&#8221; and subsequently narrowing that down to the overlapping range, I added a static field:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3949966.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This field allowed the main algorithm to look something like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3950102.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Do you see the bug?  <strong>The terrible, horrible, no good, very bad bug?</strong>  xUnit did.</p>
<p>The 3 rules I was applying were involved yet test-friendly, so it was easy to implement several tests to make sure my bases were covered.  All was well, until I got to the seventh test.  It failed with an impossible result.  The dates in the resulting range didn&#8217;t even show up anywhere in my test setup.  Mystified, I ran that test in the debugger.  It passed!  I ran the whole test class a few times, and this one test would pass or fail at random.  This was extremely odd, as the code under test seemed to be clearly deterministic.</p>
<h2>Excessive Mutation</h2>
<p>Realizing that xUnit was running my tests in a different order each time helped me to see my mistake.  This implementation of DateRange is mutable, and AllOfTime is static and therefore shared.  AllOfTime is a shared mutable thing whose name suggests an immutable thing.  AllOfTime is lying.</p>
<p>I had broken my own rule: I make classes immutable by default, making them mutable as soon as being dogmatic starts to hurt.  Instead, I had made this mutable from the start and immediately tripped on my own intellectual shoelaces.  Marking the properties as read-only forced me to rephrase the main logic, but that actually resulted in simplifying everything and ensured that AllOfTime is in fact <em>all</em> of it:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3949968.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>DateRange deserves to be a value just like DateTimes deserve to be values.  You can&#8217;t <em>change</em> 10/24/2012 any more than you can change the number 5. 5 will always be 5, 10/24/2012 will always be 10/24/2012, and the range [10/24/2012, 10/31/2012] will always be the range [10/24/2012, 10/31/2012].</p>
<p>As a general rule, I avoid mutation.  If I did that everywhere, though, my code would likely become too hard to follow.  As soon as keeping things immutable becomes a larger pain than the pain it solves, I back off and allow mutable state to come into the picture.  Even then, I try to limit the &#8220;footprint&#8221; of that state change.</p>
<p>Unnecessary mutation makes it too easy to make trivial mistakes.</p>

			How We Decided on Our Current Vacation Policy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; float: left" align="left" src="http://www.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/170x170/work-vacation-policy-bkt_3122.jpg"></p>
<p>I very much liked the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1269-the-github-hiring-experience">GitHub write-up</a> on how they hire.&nbsp; It made me think back to a lot of decisions we’ve made at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a>.&nbsp; One of them is the decision on vacation policy.&nbsp; With a mostly salaried work force, benefits is a big concern, and vacation is one of those.&nbsp; Here, I’ll attempt to share the progression of our vacation policy and how it came about.</p>
<p>First, in 2007/2008 H1, Headspring had just added its 6th employee.&nbsp; The vacation policy was simple but not consistent.&nbsp; On paper, we said “two weeks” for everyone.&nbsp; In practice, we worked too much and didn’t even track days off.&nbsp; Then, by the end of 2008, we grew to over twelve employees and had to modify the policy.&nbsp; If memory serves me, it was in 2009 when we had real conversations and came up with a policy.</p>
<h2>The first real policy</h2>
<p>The idea that arose from having an employee retrospective was that we hired mature professionals, and we didn’t need to have a time-bound, cookie-cutter policy for everyone.&nbsp; The policy that we created them was a “<strong>use as much as you need</strong>” vacation policy.&nbsp; Everyone loved that policy.&nbsp; It communicated to all employees several things.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a professional
<li>We trust you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn’t track days off at all.&nbsp; Over the course of the next two years, we found that this policy left a lot of questions on the table.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ok.&nbsp; I can take as much vacation as I want?&nbsp; Clearly that can’t be the case?
<li>How much vacation is too much?
<li>How much vacation is too little?</li>
</ul>
<p>With highly analytical employees who hold themselves to a high standard, the policy of “whatever” proved to be too ambiguous.&nbsp; Folks did take vacation, but there was always an uneasiness of being unsure of expectations in this area.&nbsp; After another company meeting on the topic – probably around the time of twenty (20) employees, we honed the policy yet again.</p>
<h2>Changing the policy</h2>
<p>First, we re-established a commitment to a 40-hour work week.&nbsp; While some companies boast “we work hard, and we play hard”, we established a “work hard and go home” standard.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; We don’t have a ping-pong table in the office (although our office complex does have horseshoes, sand volleyball, a basketball court, and a Frisbee golf setup).&nbsp; After communicating this, we made the policy for non-billable staff two or three weeks (in addition to the 7 company holidays we have) based on level in the company.&nbsp; The policy for our software engineers (most of the company) became based on billed time.&nbsp; With a standard of a 40-hour work week, we established a percent of the year that we needed to work on client projects in order for the company to remain financially healthy.&nbsp; After all, we make our money by building great custom software for our clients so they can compete in their industries.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The solution, then was to based vacation time on the percent of 2080 hours (a year of 40-hour weeks) that we expected to be billed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In effect, by billing continuously for a couple of months, a week of vacation would then pull the percent of time billed down to where we needed it (80%).&nbsp; This system actually worked very well.&nbsp; Everyone knew exactly how much vacation they could take and still meet their commitment for billed time.&nbsp; I must insert here that we don’t have bonuses for top billers.&nbsp; We are a software engineering firm and not a straight consulting company.&nbsp; Therefore, our goal is not to maximize individual billed time to a client.&nbsp; Our goal is to deliver one awesome software system after another.&nbsp; Often we finish milestones early and leave budget on the table.&nbsp; This is celebrated, not lamented.</p>
<p>With this policy in place, everyone knew what to do, and by tracking our client time, we knew exactly how much time off we could afford per person.&nbsp;&nbsp; One gentleman saved up for himself four weeks of vacation time.</p>
<h2>How the policy broke, and what we did about it</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/CropperCapture63.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="CropperCapture[63]" border="0" alt="CropperCapture[63]" align="right" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/CropperCapture63_thumb.png" width="244" height="140"></a>This policy carried us to early 2012.&nbsp; Now, at 30 employees, we have a different policy.&nbsp; The currently policy is much simpler and requires much less math.&nbsp; It is much more in alignment with our philosophy of “light on policy, heavy on judgment.”&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now changed the policy for our software engineers to&nbsp; be the following: 80% client work, 10% non-client company time, and 10% personal time.&nbsp; That means that 10% of the year, it’s yours.&nbsp; With a 52-week year, it is 5.2 weeks.&nbsp; We have found that most people don’t take 5.2 weeks of vacation per year, so that is enough for sick days, other stuff, and small bits of time off spread throughout the year as well.&nbsp; Then, the 10% of company time covers our staff meetings, fun quarterly off-sites, and other stuff.&nbsp; We put that policy in place because we found that a few people we uneasy about taking vacation because they were afraid of bench time.&nbsp; Our policy had not taken that into account.&nbsp; We wanted everyone to take vacation, and now the current policy ensures that.</p>
<h2>What will it be next?</h2>
<p>I have no idea.&nbsp; We’ve tweaked it over the years, and if we find another downside to the current policy, we’ll tweak it again.&nbsp; The good news is that we have such great people who live the company values, that they tend to speak up if something isn’t right.&nbsp; One of our company values is honest communication (candor), and they do a great job of living this one out.&nbsp; </p>

			The Failed Record of the Software Industry–why Software People Don’t Get It</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Standish Group is an organization that has been studying and reporting on software projects for many years.&nbsp; In 1995, it reported that only 16.2% of software projects succeeded.&nbsp; In large companies, the number was only 8%.&nbsp; That is, these projects were on time and on budget.&nbsp; In 2012, there is some improvement.&nbsp; The 2012 report discusses waterfall projects and agile projects.&nbsp; A <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/uploads/blog/Agile-Waterfall-Success-Failure-Rates.jpg">summary of the success stats</a> demonstrates that agile projects do improve things across the board.&nbsp; That’s not surprising given that the 1995 report cited lack of stakeholder involvement and incomplete requirements as the top two contributing factors.&nbsp; <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile principles</a> address both of those.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The 2012 report is still fairly damning of the industry as a whole.&nbsp; It cites 12% success rate for waterfall projects and 42% success rates for agile projects.&nbsp; Firms like <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a>, with a 95% success rate, have embraced agile, of course, but there is still so much more to be desired by the track record of the industry.&nbsp; In 2012, 9% of agile projects still out-right fail, and 49% are “challenged”. i.e. they unacceptably ran over budget and/or over schedule – either can have significant impacts on the business.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Car_crash_1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 7px 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Car_crash_1" border="0" alt="Car_crash_1" align="left" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Car_crash_1_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="304"></a>The industry even pokes fun at itself in a famous Internet meme, “<a href="http://www.snopes.com/humor/jokes/autos.asp">If cars were like software</a>” where we see that we have much more reasonable expectations of our automobiles than we do of software and the people who make software. Somehow, the software vendors/programmers have set the expectations of paying customers (and executives) so low that they celebrate the smallest successes even in the face of massive budget overruns and late launches.</p>
<p><strong>This is not acceptable!&nbsp; </strong>Software people don’t get it.&nbsp; Programmers have been writing mission-critical business systems for decades.&nbsp; The newness is gone.&nbsp; The trial period of “we’re figuring out how to do this” is well over.&nbsp; Now is the time when paying customers must demand more from programmers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As an executive of a <a href="http://headspring.com">software engineering firm</a>, I see the perspective of our clients.&nbsp; They have a business that is pushing forward in their industries.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a really old information system that must be revamped in order to take advantage of changes in the industry.&nbsp; Or they need some automation for a brand new market offering.&nbsp; The success of the business initiative rides on many factors, software being one of them.&nbsp; They cannot afford to gamble with a failed $1M (or more) project.&nbsp; Besides the money, once the project calendar has come and gone, you can’t get those months back.&nbsp; Whether you hire a <a href="http://headspring.com">firm</a>, do it in-house, or hire contractors in India, a failed project by any cause could mean the end of the career by the manager in charge of the product or initiative.&nbsp; And it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>Right now, across the industry, clients are forced to literally gamble with their capital investments and time.&nbsp; With less than 50% of projects (even the new and improved agile variety) succeeding, clients many times have no recourse but to gamble.&nbsp; The smooth-talking sales personnel do their bonding and rapport.&nbsp; Then comes the confidence building.&nbsp; Then the project plan and schedule – all works of fiction.&nbsp; And don’t forget the budget, which magically covers the time period the project plan lays out.&nbsp; Once the project gets started, the software engineers work for a while – hold meetings according to their agile process – track burn-downs, measure lots of agile numbers – then what comes out the other end is your 42% chance of succeeding.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In order to increase the pitiful industry track record, software engineers need to change.&nbsp; And when saying “software engineers”, I’m referring to any person responsible for delivering software. Some companies have a plethora of titles and segmentation of specialty, but it’s all software engineering (i.e. software engineering includes leadership).&nbsp; The bed of education and training currently in place does not produce the results that clients demand.&nbsp; I hope to elaborate more on this soon.</p>

			Ain&#8217;t Any Is All Ain&#8217;t</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, ReSharper made the same suspicious suggestion to both my coworker and me.  We both had the task of checking a potentially-large collection for items that fail to pass a test, and we both phrased these like so: &#8220;if not any of the items fail, continue…&#8221;.  In each case, ReSharper wanted to rephrase our statements, and it seemed like following the suggestion would be a change for the worse! </p>
<h2>An Offensive Suggestion</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s what each of our situations boiled down to:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3903096.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>We leaned on the Any() extension method, with the intention of &#8220;short circuiting&#8221; the underlying loop.  Any() starts at the front of the list, and tests each item until one of them passes the condition in the lambda expression.  Once we hit that item, there is no need to continue processing items, so Any() returns early.  This is similar to the way that the || operator works: in the expression (a() || b() || c()), we only bother to call method c() when a() and b() are both false.</p>
<p>So, it seems the ReSharper suggestion is only <em>technically</em> the same.  You&#8217;ll get the same answer, but surely testing &#8220;All&#8221; the items is potentially wasteful in the event that the collection is large.</p>
<p>What a terrible suggestion!  So terrible, I wanted to write an angry letter to the editor of my local newspaper: &#8220;…these nogoodniks, these ne&#8217;er-do-wells over at <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">JetBrains</a> need to <strong>turn that racket down and get off my lawn!</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t, though, because I was completely wrong.</p>
<h2>Oops</h2>
<p>While searching for a code sample demonstrating this ReSharper suggestion, I found the truth: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9027530/linq-not-any-vs-all-dont">Not Any vs All Don&#8217;t</a>.</p>
<p>The top answer reveals the actual implementation of both Any() and All().  Naturally, <em>both</em> Any() and All() are implemented with the &#8220;short circuit&#8221; logic mentioned above.  Any() behaves like (a() || b() || c()), <strong>and All() behaves like (a() && b() && c())</strong>.  Both have the opportunity to stop looking at items as soon as they have enough information to have the correct final answer.</p>
<p>My mistake was to read too much into the use of the word &#8220;All&#8221; without actually thinking about how it could be best implemented.  Yet again, ReSharper has proven itself to be clearly smarter than me.</p>

			Jack Welch MBA–a New Graduate</a>

<p>If you aren’t familiar, Jack Welch was the CEO of <a href="http://www.ge.com/">General Electric</a> from 1981 to 2001.&nbsp; That’s a lot of years!&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, he shares his knowledge and experience with people like me – and whoever else enrolls in his MBA program.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" alt="Logo-strayer.png" align="right" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Logo-strayer.png">JWMI is a program hosted at <a href="http://www.strayer.edu/">Strayer University</a>, which is a nationwide university that has been around since 1892 – not as old as my alma mater, <a href="http://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&amp;M</a> (1872/6), but very proven.&nbsp; Chances are there is a Strayer location in a city near you.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate to have a great classmate who took the courses with me.&nbsp; <a href="http://headspring.com/kevin">Kevin Hurwitz</a>, the Chief Architect at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a>, also just received his MBA from JWMI.&nbsp; Each course, we were able to swap notes and apply the knowledge every week at Headspring.</p>
<p>Throughout the two years, I completed courses on a broad range of topics.&nbsp; They are listed here.&nbsp; As I blog about what I have learned and applied in each course, I’ll link to that blog from this list.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.headspring.com/jeffrey/jack-welch-mba-course-business-communication-and-ethics/">Business Communications and Ethics</a>
<li>Leading in the 21st Century
<li>Strategy
<li>People Management
<li>Marketing in a Global Environment
<li>Managerial Economics
<li>Operations Management
<li>Financial Management I
<li>Organizational Change and Culture
<li>Financial Management II
<li>New Business Ventures and Entrepreneurship
<li>Capstone (simulation)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very happy to have attended and graduated from the Jack Welch Management Institute.&nbsp; My contribution to Headspring has materially benefited from the learning.&nbsp; Also, I am so excited that several other Headspringers have decided to enroll for this semester!</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Justin Mason</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/photo-3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5799" title="Justin Mason - Headspring Principal Consultant" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/photo-3-224x300.jpg" alt="Justin Mason - Headspring Principal Consultant" width="224" height="300" /></a>Justin Mason is our newest team member at Headspring. An experienced developer, Justin joins us from Catapult Systems where he designed and developed a sensor data recording and management application for natural gas and oil drilling rigs. Justin has a passion for the ever-changing landscape of viable technologies and their potential applications, which makes him a great addition to our team of like minded and ambitious people!</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I have more than 15 years of application development experience. In that time, I’ve seen the evolution of the Web. By understanding where technology originated, it helps provide a clearer picture of where it may go.  The uncertainty of how competing priorities have shaped the software applications that are currently available makes it an exciting time to be at Headspring to contribute to the needs of its customers.</p>
<p>I became passionate about Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) because I understood the pain it was trying to alleviate for companies.  Bidirectional communication using binary serialization over TCP that can be easily transitioned to other transportation protocols like HTTP really caught my interest.  WCF has had to keep pace with the industry due to emerging technologies such as Ajax using JSON serialization instead of SOAP. Its use in the background will remain intact while abstractions are built on top of it to facilitate new applications.       </p>
<p><strong>Who are your ideal clients to work for?</strong></p>
<p>The best part of software development is that it has allowed me to work across a wide range of companies. If software can help solve a business problem, we want to work with a company to do it. Then the only other factor is the willingness of the company to come together to work with developers and rely on their expertise to find a technical solution.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I was led to software by the idea that I could get paid to put together puzzles.  Software allows you to use your imagination to visualize a concept and then bring that concept into something others can see and interact with.  When a day goes by without noticing it, you know the career you have chosen is the right one.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>Besides my introduction to software in elementary school using “Turtle Graphics”, I learned Visual Basic 4 along with Relational Databases coming out of college and started my first “real” job.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I like teaching very much.  I owe my own career to friends and colleagues that took the time to show me how to learn the various technologies.  I enjoy the different ways people learn similar concepts.  Having to adapt to different learning styles makes the teacher’s own understanding greater.  As a result, everyone comes out ahead.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I ask myself whether I’ve added to my understanding of something new, or did I complete a defined objective?  Time wasted is usually a result of a lack of clear objectives, or misunderstanding a concept foundational to a new technology.</p>
