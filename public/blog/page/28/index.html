			Dependency Injection Ceremony</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The vast majority of the time, I enjoy working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection</a>.  Sometimes, however, I find myself rolling my eyes at the amount of &#8220;ceremony&#8221; boilerplate code it takes in order to take advantage of it.  <em>Disclaimer: This is more a limitation of C# having been created before DI containers became common than a problem with DI itself.</em>
</p>
<p>DI and its benefits have been written about for years, but the short version is that your classes can accept interface arguments through their constructors, and these arguments represent the class&#8217;s dependencies.  A simple example can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc-examples/blob/master/src/Actions/HandlerStyle/SimpleWebsite/Handlers/Movies/ListHandler.cs">FubuMVC samples</a>:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2641353.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Here, the ListHandler class is declaring, incidentally to the compiler but primarily to the <em>reader</em>, that it depends on a repository to do its work.  Rather than construct a <code>new Repository()</code> itself, it assumes a pre-constructed <code>IRepository</code> will be provided.</p>
<p>At a minimum, this is convenient in the case that the <code>Repository</code> constructor itself has potentially-tricky-to-instantiate arguments, each of which may have their own constructors to call, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>More importantly, since your class no longer has to &#8216;new up&#8217; the dependencies itself, it is decoupled from the concrete implementations of those dependencies.  At test time, you can pass in a mock or stub implementation to prove that your class makes use of the abstraction as expected, and at run time you can trust a tool like <a href="http://docs.structuremap.net/">StructureMap</a> to create and pass in the real implementation.  When looking at a class written in this style, you can quickly see what it depends on by looking at its constructor, rather than looking through the entire class definition.</p>
<h2>Playing Devil&#8217;s Advocate</h2>
<p>The ListHandler class is easy to read, easy to understand, so easy to test that it might not be worth the bother, and it absolutely follows the Single Responsibility Principle.  It&#8217;s simple, basically the &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; of Dependency Injection, but simple is a good thing to shoot for whenever we put our hands on a keyboard.  It&#8217;s a Good Class.</p>
<p>However, when I find myself writing similar single-responsibility classes with a dependency or two passed to the constructor, a little imaginary Devil pops up on my left shoulder, accompanied by his Angel twin on my right.  The Devil wispers, &#8220;Why in the <em>heck</em> are you writing all that boilerplate!?&#8221; and the little Angel looks at the class and says, &#8220;Yeah, I hate to say this, but I think you should be listening to <em>that</em> guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does this class tell the reader?  First, it says &#8220;I depend on a repository.&#8221;  Then it says &#8220;And when I say repository, I mean repository.&#8221;  Followed by &#8220;No, seriously dude, we&#8217;re talking about a repository here.&#8221;  When we inject an interface like this, we pay the syntax tax by saying &#8216;repository&#8217; <strong>six times in a row</strong>.  12 lines so that we could say the 1 line that we actually wanted to say.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not a problem with DI itself.  This is a problem of the language not knowing DI would be so prevalent.  What we really want, in these single-method dependency-injected classes, is effectively a global function, with some arguments specially-marked as dependencies.  Consider a hypothetical C# from the future:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2641473.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Such a function, if it could be declared, could be called with zero arguments when we want a real IRepository injected, and could be passed an IRepository at test time.  What do you think?  Would this kind of language support be useful in practice?</p>

			Delegate Frustration</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the things I like about C#&#8217;s delegate types, compared to similar concepts in other languages, is that C#&#8217;s take on the concept lets you give a useful <em>name</em> to a family of functions:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2582885.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>With this definition, all functions that turn one thing into another thing are Converters.  Nice.</p>
<p>We also have some generically-named <code>Action&lt;…&gt;</code> and <code>Func&lt;…&gt;</code> delegate types defined for us, and these have become ubiquitous ever since LINQ was introduced.  They&#8217;re not as communicative, but still extremely useful, and for the most part the naming stays out of the way.</p>
<p>Delegate types allow you to give a name to a family of functions.  However, you can run into trouble when you use two different names to refer to the <em>same</em> family of functions:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2582784.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Since all methods are compatable with any delegate type that has matching input/output types, why aren&#8217;t the following queries equivalent?</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2582790.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This was a little frustrating when C# 3 came out.  Before then, all the delegate types we were used to working with had explicit names like <code>Converter</code> and <code>Predicate</code>.  When C# 3 introduced lambdas and LINQ, we gained <code>Func&lt;…&gt;</code> and <code>Action&lt;…&gt;</code>, and I found myself stumbling while converting older code to use the new LINQ extension methods like <code>Select</code>, which takes a <code>Func&lt;T, TResult&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s extra-frustrating because <em>every single Converter&lt;T, TResult> method that ever lived is also a Func&lt;T, TResult>!</em> I know it, you know it, Grandma tweeted it.  We can drive that point home by making the <code>convert</code> delegate work with <code>Select</code> by wrapping it in a trivial do-nothing lambda: <code>integers.Select(x =&gt; convert(x));</code>  Yeesh!</p>
<p>To help make sense of this behavior, we can make an analogy between delegates and interfaces.</p>
<p>Think of a delegate <em>type</em> as a special kind of interface type.  The interface has only one method, called &#8220;Call&#8221;.  Since it is <em>always</em> called &#8220;Call&#8221;, you can shorten the reader-unfriendly <code>convert.Call(5)</code> to simply <code>convert(5)</code>.</p>
<p>Think of a method as an <em>instance</em> of these interfaces.  All methods implement the infinite number of possible delegate &#8216;interfaces&#8217; that match their input and output types.  <code>Stringify</code> is an object that implements the imaginary <code>IConverter&lt;int, string&gt;</code> interface, and also implements the imaginary <code>IFunc&lt;int, string&gt;</code> interface.  Both of these interfaces just happen to contain the imaginary method with the signature: <code>string Call(int x)</code>.</p>
<p>Now, the example above makes more sense.  We have two variables declared as &#8216;interface&#8217; types, and assign the same object to both variables.  <code>Select</code> is written to accept instances of one &#8216;interface&#8217; type, and although <code>convert</code> points at a method compatable with <code>Select</code>, <code>convert</code> itself can only be seen as having some other, incompatible type.</p>

			Another Tiny Contribution to WebApiContrib</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have the privilege of working with lots of smart people. Sometimes they blog about things that are new, weird, wrong or backwards. <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/">Jimmy Bogard</a> posted something the other day that, to me, was weird. If you’re bringing <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a> into an existing ASP.NET web site or application, you probably want your API custom errors to match your web app’s custom errors. By default, this isn’t hooked up out of the box. In Jimmy’s post on <a href="http://lostechies.com/">Los Techies</a>, you’ll notice how he solves this problem.</p>
<h3><strong>What is ASP.NET Web API?</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve worked with ASP.NET’s take on HTTP for quite some time, but I&#8217;m usually the guy that avoids the past opinions of the Microsoft team. I feel like I understand how the web works and bulky .NET classes around it seem heavy handed and usually overkill; I try to avoid them at all costs. This is why ASP.NET Web API appeals to me. It’s a lighter-weight approach to the web with C# and the .NET stack. A few individuals have been paying attention to this for a few months now and I decided to help out a little bit after.</p>
<h3><strong>Why WebApiContrib?</strong></h3>
<p>While I’ve been focusing a good amount of time onASP.NET Web API, I decided that his post was a perfect fit for a small amount of code in the <a href="http://webapicontrib.github.com/">WebApiContrib</a> project. This project is aimed to be a supplement to what Web API already provides. It&#8217;s still new, and the help of the community can really drive this project in the right direction.</p>
<h3><strong>Adding Code to WebApiContrib</strong></h3>
<p>I went ahead and took <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/04/18/custom-errors-and-error-detail-policy-in-asp-net-web-api/">Jimmy’s blog post</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebApiContrib/WebAPIContrib/commit/27381146d65b3958cf267e7bb7fcd80e1b913b66">turned it into code</a> so it could be used <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/webapicontrib">straight from NuGet</a>. If you are ever wanting to give back to open source and you read a blog post like this one. You’re basically being tossed a lob ball. Thanks Jimmy!</p>

			Becoming a Headspringer: My First Week</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2 dir="ltr">Welcome Number 7941</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d like for you to take a moment and imagine that today is your first day at a new company.  You enter the building wearing the carefully selected slacks and shirt ironed the night before.  You&#8217;re filled with nervous energy, but confident, because out of the fifty plus candidates, who did they select to write their new custom software solution?  That&#8217;s right, you.</p>
<p>The friendly HR rep that recruited you shakes your hand and leads you to a large conference room where you attend a new hire orientation.  You&#8217;re promptly handed an employee handbook the size of a telephone book and sit down.  Opening to a random page on Computer/IT Usage policies you learn that it&#8217;s against company policies to look at **cough** questionable **cough** images on company computers.  Interesting, you think to yourself, I figured that was common knowledge.</p>
<p>Over the next four hours you listen to HR representatives speak about company history, company policies, and benefits.  You fill out form after form of information asking for social security numbers, driver&#8217;s license number, passport number and other private information.  You&#8217;re handed a badge with an employee number, 7941.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/04/becoming-a-headspringer-my-first-week/cubicle-hell" rel="attachment wp-att-4917"><img class="size-full wp-image-4917 aligncenter" title="Sea of Cubicles" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/cubicle-hell.jpg" alt="Sea of Cubicles" width="650" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>Next they take you on a tour of the office.  On the first floor is sales, marketing and HR.  On the second floor is Engineering.  At this point you&#8217;ve been blasted with so much canned information that mentally you only take note of the bathroom locations.</p>
<p>The elevator door opens on the third floor and your tour guide herds your group through the sea of Customer Service cubicles until you reach the IT department and HR hands you off to your new tour guide, your manager.  He or she introduces you to the entire team and leaves you in your cubicle.  Sitting down, you realize you don&#8217;t have a computer at your desk.  You think to yourself, what does a software developer do without a computer?</p>
<p>How many of you have a page, just like this, written in your life story?  How many of you have felt like a number, like you weren&#8217;t valued?  At Headspring, there’s a better way&#8230;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Four Core Values</h2>
<p>Let me start off by saying, at Headspring, things are different.  You quickly learn the following four core values are deeply held at the core of a Headspringer.</p>
<p>- Drive for Excellence<br />
- People are Valued<br />
- Honest Communication<br />
- Passion for Learning and Growth</p>
<p>Within the first week, time and time again I witnessed Headspringers demonstrating these four values in every interaction.  Let me take a few moments to detail just a few of them.<br />
A week before my start date I received a delivery of piping hot, freshly baked cookies from the founder and CEO, Dustin Wells.  Now I&#8217;m definitely not known to have a sweet tooth, but the cookies were just plain awesome; and seriously, how cool is that to have the owner of the company value me as a new hire?</p>
<p>Three business days before my start date, I received an email from the director of software development, Glenn Burnside.  I was the proud owner of a shiny new Headspring Google account.  Being a naturally curious person, I logged in to find ten or more introduction emails to various systems such as the Intranet, BitBucket repositories, and Agile Zen Projects.  Wow, I haven&#8217;t started yet and I&#8217;m already trusted with sensitive information such as the admin credentials to the production server.  This level of transparent communication across an organization was and still is amazing to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/04/becoming-a-headspringer-my-first-week/headstream094" rel="attachment wp-att-4918"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4918" title="Headspring Offices" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/headstream094.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="289" /></a></p>
<p>On my first day at the Headspring office I arrived to find my desk already outfitted with business cards, moleskine journals, a Headspring shirt, and most importantly a fully configured laptop with two 24&#8221; monitors.  When I say fully configured, I don&#8217;t mean it has RAM, a working Hard Drive and is plugged in.  I mean that it&#8217;s fully configured with almost every software development tool that I use, from TestDriven.Net to Notepad++ to Redgate SQL Toolbelt.  I only downloaded and installed the obscure tools that I use such as Beyond Compare, Wunderlist, gVim, and Cygwin.  By the end of the day, with guidance from teammates, I was up and running, tackling tasks in the backlog.</p>
<p>Four days into the new job and I had my first one-on-one meeting with Glenn.  Here we talked candidly about expectations and goals.  The conversation drifted towards the on ramp process and during that discussion he asked for my opinion and took a suggestion I had on the process.<br />
That&#8217;s when it hit me.  The four core values are a deep commitment at Headspring starting from the top leadership all the way down.  Glenn had taken something so simple like the on ramp process of a new employee and the drive for excellence had motivated everyone to thoughtfully deconstruct and improve the process.  This is what it means to be a Headspringer.</p>
<p>Working at Headspring has already been an amazing experience.  It&#8217;s a pleasure to work with individuals who have a deep passion and commitment to developing not only software, but each other.  So I feel compelled to ask you this question.  What&#8217;s keeping you from <a href="http://www.headspring.com/about-us/careers">applying</a>?</p>
