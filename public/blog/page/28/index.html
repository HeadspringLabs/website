		<p align="justify">TDD or <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html" target="_blank">Test Driven Development</a> was considered an industry buzz for a while.

<p align="justify">Over last 5 year, I have transition through different stages of mind set when it comes to unit testing or TDD in general. As an early adoptor I was curious to know to what extend we can take this concept. At this stage, my unit test looked more state testing i.e</p>

			Review of Robert Martin&#8217;s the Clean Coder</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Humans learn from experience. Learning to be a consultant is a pinnacle of this idea- you cannot pick up a book, read it, work a few exercises in an isolated setting, and be a consultant. However, The Clean Coder by Robert Martin puts readers in the right direction and starts them down the path to being a true professional by giving the reader both a code of conduct to live by and plethora of stories detailing Martin&#8217;s own experiences and pitfalls. This second-hand experience is the best possible resource that can be put into text, and while it will not guarantee that the reader will never make spills of their own, it reveals several of the obvious- and not so obvious- pitfalls that are on the path to being a professional developer.</p>
<p>This book is thin, but a very dense read; it covers a true variety of subjects, many of which that are crucial for consultants - when and how to say no and yes professionally, test driven development, project management, teamwork, and estimation, to name several. But it is because of this wealth of topics that Martin is able to show readers that professionalism and the path to a long and respected career involves dedication, practice, and time.</p>
<p>This is a book I would recommend not only to new software professionals, but experienced ones as well- because Martin also delves into the more detailed issues of professionalism and career development, even established professionals might learn a thing or two. There is also a section on mentoring that should prove useful to current professionals- because sharing knowledge is just as, if not more, important than obtaining it.</p>
<p>Overall, this book provides a solid foundation for any new software development career by giving the reader contextual experience as well as well-thought-out, time-tested rules to govern the start of a new (or existing) career as a software developer. The Clean Coder pulls all of these important topics into a central text, lending a much-needed resource to the software development community.</p>

		<p>If it can&#8217;t be drawn, it can&#8217;t be built. It’s the mantra in our office. Having heard it almost every day that I have been here at Headspring, I never really understood its power before I set out on the (thought to be exciting) task of rebuilding the company website.</p>
<p>I knew I’d have to gather requirements for the site. Having no idea of what requirement gathering techniques were out there I just started a word document list: pages, forms, content.  When I sat down with the team to start developing the site, they needed more information about site flow.

			PowerShell and the Principle of Most Astonishment</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When designing a user interface, it&#8217;s important to avoid conflicts between what an action actually does and what the user <em>expects</em> it to do. Our goal is to minimize surprises to ensure a smooth end-user experience. This is called the <a title="Principle of Least Astonishment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">Principle of Least Astonishment</a>.</p>
<p>This principle should also be important to language designers. Just like a slick, AJAX-y web page is a user interface for the end user, a programming language&#8217;s syntax is a user interface for developers. When the rules of a language conflict with a typical developer&#8217;s mental model of what the rules <em>might</em> be, we have a problem every bit as serious as a confusing user-facing dialog.</p>
<p>After running into some hurdles using PowerShell, it seems that this language follows the Principle of <em>Most</em> Astonishment. Because its actual model conflicts with the mental model most developers take for granted in similar languages, it is very easy to run into some frustrating bugs.</p>
<p>Programming lanaguages can be dropped into several broad categories when they encourage similar mental models. For the Imperative Object-Oriented Languages, this makes it easy to start with Python and then learn Ruby, Java, and the like: they all have roughly similar notions of imperative control flow,

			Jazz-Up Your CSS With Transitions</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While JavaScript has historically been the go-to technology for animating CSS properties, CSS 3 brings us transitions: a declarative syntax for defining the transition between styles.</p>
<p>Adding transitions to your CSS is quite simple. First, define the &#8220;start&#8221; and &#8220;end&#8221; states of your HTML elements as separate rules, like so.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1114324.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Then, add the appropriate properties for transitioning your elements to both states (necessary since we&#8217;ll be transitioning both <em>to</em> and <em>from</em> each state).

			How to Add a Method to ViewBag in ASP.NET MVC</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We are all familiar with the basic HomeController in the default ASP.NET MVC project.  We know we can pass values from the controller to the view.  Sometimes we are tempted to pass the controller itself to the view so that we can call methods on it.  The view should not have to depend on the controller.  This post provides a way to accomplish this.  For more on ASP.NET MVC, check out my book, <a href="http://bit.ly/aspnetmvc3inaction">ASP.NET MVC 3 in Action</a>.

			Developing ASP.NET MVC With Visual Web Developer Express 2010</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When the “Express” line of Visual Studio products was introduced with Visual Studio 2008, the Web Developer tool was a one-trick pony.  You could create a web site, and that was pretty much it.  No support for groupings of projects into solutions.  In other words, you couldn’t create libraries at the same time as the web site.</p>
<p>When ASP.NET came on the scene, this posed a problem.  MVC required web application projects, not the web site directory.  Visual Web Developer was enhanced a few times along with the way, and now it is a much more usable package.

			Creating a Glimpse Plugin to Log SQL Generated by NHibernate</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Glimpse has generated a lot of buzz since it was <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/HanselminutesOn9/Hanselminutes-on-9-Glimpse-at-the-Mix11-Open-Source-Fest" target="_blank">unveiled</a> earlier this year during the “Open Source Fest” at the Mix 2011 conference. If you’re not already using it to debug your ASP.NET Web Forms or MVC application, you should be. Glimpse allows you to inspect several server-side diagnostic and request related information with a UI just like Firebug. Here’s some resources to get you started if you need an intro:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://getglimpse.com/" target="_blank">GetGlimpse.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NuGetPackageOfTheWeek5DebuggingASPNETMVCApplicationsWithGlimpse.aspx" target="_blank">NuGet Package of the Week – Glimpse</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several <a href="http://getglimpse.com/Help" target="_blank">built-in plugins</a> for Web Forms and MVC that will serve many needs, and you can even create your own. This tutorial will demonstrate how to create a plugin that will display the SQL generated by NHibernate.</p>
<h2>Glimpse Plugins</h2>
<p>Plugins are implemented by a simple class that implements the IGlimpsePlugin interface. There are a couple of great “hello world” example plugins on the Glimpse <a href="http://getglimpse.com/Help/CreatingPlugins" target="_blank">creating plugins page</a>. Besides setting the name and some optional start-up code, a plugin’s main job is just to return some set of data that will be rendered to the Glimpse UI. What that data is and how we get it is the real magic, so read on below.

		<p>I started my career as a programmer. I was fortunate enough to get into computing as the Internet revolution was a strong possibility in the early nineties. My career has largely followed the rise of the PC, the Internet, and now cloud computing. Being one of the first on my block with an email address and a web site (which we called &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page">home pages</a>&#8221; back then), I started web development very early.

<p>TDD is an excellent safeguard against bugs. Why is test-driven development specifically vital in Agile development?</p>
<p>The hardest part of implementing a new feature is keeping all of the existing features working.</p>
<p>Software can be very complicated, and if you were trying to visualize it, although I don&#8217;t like to compare the software we build to a Rube Goldberg machine, you might be able to think of it in those terms, in that if you have a device which works in just such a way and then you add to it there is a good chance that it will no longer continue to work like it did.
