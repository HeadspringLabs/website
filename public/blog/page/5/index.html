			The Failed Record of the Software Industry–why Software People Don’t Get It</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Standish Group is an organization that has been studying and reporting on software projects for many years.&nbsp; In 1995, it reported that only 16.2% of software projects succeeded.&nbsp; In large companies, the number was only 8%.&nbsp; That is, these projects were on time and on budget.&nbsp; In 2012, there is some improvement.&nbsp; The 2012 report discusses waterfall projects and agile projects.&nbsp; A <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/uploads/blog/Agile-Waterfall-Success-Failure-Rates.jpg">summary of the success stats</a> demonstrates that agile projects do improve things across the board.&nbsp; That’s not surprising given that the 1995 report cited lack of stakeholder involvement and incomplete requirements as the top two contributing factors.&nbsp; <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile principles</a> address both of those.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The 2012 report is still fairly damning of the industry as a whole.&nbsp; It cites 12% success rate for waterfall projects and 42% success rates for agile projects.&nbsp; Firms like <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a>, with a 95% success rate, have embraced agile, of course, but there is still so much more to be desired by the track record of the industry.&nbsp; In 2012, 9% of agile projects still out-right fail, and 49% are “challenged”. i.e. they unacceptably ran over budget and/or over schedule – either can have significant impacts on the business.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Car_crash_1.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 7px 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Car_crash_1" border="0" alt="Car_crash_1" align="left" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Car_crash_1_thumb.jpg" width="404" height="304"></a>The industry even pokes fun at itself in a famous Internet meme, “<a href="http://www.snopes.com/humor/jokes/autos.asp">If cars were like software</a>” where we see that we have much more reasonable expectations of our automobiles than we do of software and the people who make software. Somehow, the software vendors/programmers have set the expectations of paying customers (and executives) so low that they celebrate the smallest successes even in the face of massive budget overruns and late launches.</p>
<p><strong>This is not acceptable!&nbsp; </strong>Software people don’t get it.&nbsp; Programmers have been writing mission-critical business systems for decades.&nbsp; The newness is gone.&nbsp; The trial period of “we’re figuring out how to do this” is well over.&nbsp; Now is the time when paying customers must demand more from programmers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As an executive of a <a href="http://headspring.com">software engineering firm</a>, I see the perspective of our clients.&nbsp; They have a business that is pushing forward in their industries.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a really old information system that must be revamped in order to take advantage of changes in the industry.&nbsp; Or they need some automation for a brand new market offering.&nbsp; The success of the business initiative rides on many factors, software being one of them.&nbsp; They cannot afford to gamble with a failed $1M (or more) project.&nbsp; Besides the money, once the project calendar has come and gone, you can’t get those months back.&nbsp; Whether you hire a <a href="http://headspring.com">firm</a>, do it in-house, or hire contractors in India, a failed project by any cause could mean the end of the career by the manager in charge of the product or initiative.&nbsp; And it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>Right now, across the industry, clients are forced to literally gamble with their capital investments and time.&nbsp; With less than 50% of projects (even the new and improved agile variety) succeeding, clients many times have no recourse but to gamble.&nbsp; The smooth-talking sales personnel do their bonding and rapport.&nbsp; Then comes the confidence building.&nbsp; Then the project plan and schedule – all works of fiction.&nbsp; And don’t forget the budget, which magically covers the time period the project plan lays out.&nbsp; Once the project gets started, the software engineers work for a while – hold meetings according to their agile process – track burn-downs, measure lots of agile numbers – then what comes out the other end is your 42% chance of succeeding.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In order to increase the pitiful industry track record, software engineers need to change.&nbsp; And when saying “software engineers”, I’m referring to any person responsible for delivering software. Some companies have a plethora of titles and segmentation of specialty, but it’s all software engineering (i.e. software engineering includes leadership).&nbsp; The bed of education and training currently in place does not produce the results that clients demand.&nbsp; I hope to elaborate more on this soon.</p>
