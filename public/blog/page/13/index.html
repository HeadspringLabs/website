			Gizmos That Should Be on Your Wish List This Holiday!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At this point in the holiday season, you may be scrambling for gift giving ideas.  Who better than tried and true techies to weigh in on the must-have gadgets for the New Year. Scoop them up for someone you love or put them on your wish list!  Here are some ideas from the Headspring Development team.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse </strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Jimmy Bogard</em><strong></strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6272" title="atmafrontcurvedfy111" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/atmafrontcurvedfy111-395x300.jpeg" alt="" width="395" height="300" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/arc-touch-mouse" target="_blank">Arc Touch Mouse by Microsoft</a> is a sleek, wireless, and reliable tool that will improve the fluidity of work. It features the high-tech Touch strip technology that makes use precise. A fringe benefit for business and pleasure travel is the mouse can be flattened for easy storage!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arduino Microcontroller</strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Sharon Cichelli</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6273" title="300px-Arduino316" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/300px-Arduino316.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="209" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino microcontroller</a> is a great introduction to programming and electronics. Designed to be affordable and approachable, it opens the door for inspiring the next generation of developers.  It’s also great for building cool stuff as you work on fun projects with your sweetie or kids. It is open-source hardware supported by open-source software and a rich community of tinkerers who are happy to share their knowledge and get you started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kindle Paperwhite</strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Anne Epstein</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6274" title="MG_7921-660x439" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MG_7921-660x439-451x300.jpeg" alt="" width="451" height="300" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Touch-light/dp/B007OZNZG0" target="_blank">newest version of Kindle</a>, the “world’s most advanced e-reader,” features: higher resolution, higher contrast touchscreen, built-in light and an 8-week battery life. An improved screen, the ability for nighttime reading, and Amazon’s expansive e-book selection makes the Kindle Paperwhite a sought-after gadget this holiday!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s on your wish list this holiday?</strong></p>

			Lean Lambdas</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Shirley:</strong> Tell me about the Extract-Variable refactoring.</p>
<p><strong>Albert:</strong> Let&#8217;s say I have a long expression that has become hard to read, and that I can identify a noteworthy subexpression within it.  I can &#8216;extract&#8217; that subexpression from the original by introducing a new local variable.  The variable is initialized to the subexpression, and then the larger original expression is rewritten in terms of the new variable.  Doing so can make things easier to read: the original expression is shorter, and we&#8217;ve given a useful name to the part we took out.  For example:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264666.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>Shirley:</strong> Since we&#8217;re doing this extra step with an extra variable, will the result run a little slower than the original?</p>
<p><strong>Albert:</strong> No, silly!  We&#8217;re doing the same amount of work in both versions.  Even with the original version, the compiler had to break down the expression into many smaller steps just like the change we made.  We&#8217;re just introducing a useful nickname for one of those intermediate steps.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Is there any way Extract-Variable <em>could</em> make something faster?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Aren&#8217;t you listening!?  Oh, wait.  If the expression you are pulling out appears multiple times in the larger expression, and the cost of evaluating it is large enough to notice, then Extract-Variable could actually speed things up, since you&#8217;ll only evaluate it once.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> If you do that, is there any chance you&#8217;ll change the runtime behavior?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Only if the subexpression has side effects.  We used to evaluate it multiple times, and now we evaluate it once.  If the expression <em>does</em> something to the world other than just provide a value, we&#8217;d be introducing a breaking change.  That&#8217;s why you want to keep as much of your code as pure as reasonably possible.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Pure?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> An expression or function is pure if it depends only on its inputs and has no side effects.  It just looks at the inputs and returns a result.  For the same inputs, it always gives the same output.  <code>x+5</code> is pure, while <code>SendAnEmailToGrandma()</code> isn&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s safe to Extract-Variable with pure code, even when the subexpression showed up multiple times beforehand.  Pure stuff is easier to chop up, reorder, and move around.  It&#8217;s easier to reason about.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Imagine that we&#8217;ve got a large expression, and that the subexpression we&#8217;re extracting only appears <em>once</em>.  What if I told you we could <em>still</em> get a performance boost out of it?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Shirley, you&#8217;re joking.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Nope! I&#8217;ve got two situations in mind.  Let&#8217;s start with the easy one.  This loop is taking way too long to execute:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264673.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Oh, I see what you&#8217;re getting at.  We saw earlier how you can get a performance boost when extracting a subexpression that appeared multiple times in the original expression.  In this loop, we&#8217;ve got the same problem in a different format.  The subexpression <em>appears</em> once, but it gets <em>evalutated</em> a whole lot, each time with the same result.  We&#8217;d fix this with two refactorings: we&#8217;d Extract-Variable, and then we&#8217;d move that variable declaration <em>before</em> the loop:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264675.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Great! Earlier, I said I was thinking about two examples in which code with a singly-occurring subexpression could be sped up with Extract-Variable.  The easy one was the <code>foreach</code> you just fixed, but the second one&#8217;s tough.  Let&#8217;s improve upon the previous example.  Instead of building up a big list of all the values in the column, we&#8217;ll make a column object that uses a Func&lt;Row&gt; to evaluate each cell only as needed:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264677.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Again, we don&#8217;t want to keep on performing the costly CompileUserExpression(&#8230;) call every time we need to display a grid cell.  The problem is, if I Extract-Variable here, we&#8217;re left with the same wasteful recompilation:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264685.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> If the lambda gets called a bajillion times, how many times will we evaluate the costly part?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A bajillion.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Hmmph.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> How is this any different from the <code>foreach</code> example?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> When the costly bit was in a <code>foreach</code>, we could just move the variable to the outer scope.  Here, we have a lambda.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Doesn&#8217;t a lambda introduce a scope too?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Well, yeah, but if we move <code>compiledExpression</code> outside of the lambda, wouldn&#8217;t it become available for garbage collection as soon as we returned from <code>CreateCalculatedColumn</code>?  Let&#8217;s see:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264688.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It works!  Our lambda is referring to a variable in the surrounding scope, and we&#8217;re returning the lambda.  Lambdas are just objects, so this is just like returning any other object that references a locally-constructed thing.  The garbage collector only cleans up unreachable things, and <code>compiledExpression</code> will be reachable for as long as the lambda is reachable.  We get to avoid all that rework no matter how many times the lambda is called!</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Slick.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> How does one end a Socratic Dialogue?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> How about with a summary?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Extract-Variable starts out as a simple refactoring to improve the readability of large expressions.  When working with pure code, the change is both safe and easy to perform.  In addition to aiding readability, Extract-Variable can occasionally improve performance, when the extraction keeps us from doing a lot of excess work.  After extracting a variable, we can consider moving it to an outer scope, so long as doing so preserves behavior.  Moving it outside of a loop can prevent wasteful reevaluation across many iterations.  Likewise, moving it outside of a lambda can prevent wasteful reevaluation across many invocations of the lambda.</p>

			The Solution Is Never Inheritance</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>That&#8217;s how fellow-Headspringer <a href="https://twitter.com/scichelli">Sharon Cichelli</a> started a conversation today:  &#8220;The solution is never inheritance.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a controversial title.  Afterall, one must never, <em><strong>under any circumstances</strong></em> speak in absolutes.  &#8220;The maintainable solution is quite oft not inheritance&#8221; may be closer to the truth while missing the point entirely.  Judicious use of inheritance in small chunks can be useful, but implementation inheritance in the wild is usually a mess that gets out of hand quickly.</p>
<p>The general advice to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=composition+over+inheritance">favor composition over inheritance</a> has been written about countless times.  In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/spaghetti-alla-code/">Spaghetti alla Code</a>, I blamed the problem on the way that <code>virtual/override/base</code> keywords achieve code reuse at the cost of littering your implementation with subtle <code>goto</code>-like complexity: you have to execute every line of a class hierarchy in your head in order to know what any one class is actually going to do.  When favoring composition, you&#8217;re more likely to understand what a class does by just reading that class.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t always use implementation inheritance, but when I do, I use the Template Method Pattern and the Bucket of Small-Scope Helper Methods Pattern.</p>
<h2>The Template Method Pattern</h2>
<p>In this pattern, an abstract base class provides a basic algorithm, leaving a detail or two undefined as abstract methods.  A single-level of child classes completes the story by providing implementations for the undefined steps.    I never decide up front to use this pattern.  Rather, I refactor toward it when it&#8217;s the clearest way to remove some code duplication.</p>
<h2>The Bucket of Small-Scope Helper Methods Pattern</h2>
<p>Sure, this isn&#8217;t an official Gang of Four pattern, but it comes up often enough that it deserves a name.  I arrive at this kind of inheritance incrementally.  If I have an <em>interface</em> whose implementations take on suspiciously-similar private helper methods, and the duplication mounts up, I promote the interface to an abstract class and move the common private methods up to the base class.</p>
<p>When the scope of these helper methods is very small, the base class is an appropriate home for them, but watch out: you may be hiding a new concept here that would be more useful to the rest of your system as a separate public class.</p>
<p>I use the BoSSHM Pattern when the thought of a new public class feels like overkill or overengineering.  I don&#8217;t want to distract the reader with rarely-used classes, just for the sake of having <em>small</em> classes.</p>
<h2>Evolve Towards Inheritance</h2>
<p>Off the top of my head, I can&#8217;t think of any other time I use implementation inheritance and later think to myself, &#8220;That was a good idea!&#8221;  Also, the way I arrive at these patterns is just as important as the result: rather than being the product of up-front design, I arrive at them in small steps as code duplication pains present themselves.  Each solves <em>small</em> kinds of code duplication problems, so the resulting inheritance hierarchies are also small and therefore easy to understand.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Wayne Denier</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A native of Frederick, MD, Wayne has lived in Austin for two years and we welcome him to the Headspring team! At Headspring, Wayne focuses on the user interface and general feature coding. He previously worked at Dell Inc. and Enforme Interactive. Wayne is passionate about game development and design and is experienced in HTML, Javascript, CSS, JQuery, C# and .NET MVC.</p>
<p>We are thrilled that Wayne has become part of our Headspring family! Keep reading to learn more about Wayne.</p>
<p><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-6262 alignright" title="waynephoto" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/waynephoto-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you want to work here?</strong></p>
<p>I like working with people that get excited about what they are doing, and I believe that passion leads to pushing the boundaries of what is possible. I see a lot of that passion in the team at Headspring. Anyone who has worked with or for the company has a great standard for technical excellence, an attitude of sharing and learning, and they are passionate about their discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to clients, I like providing solutions that make complex problems seem easy. I like to make tools for people to remove frustrations in the little things they have to do to perform their jobs and enjoy building software for someone to help achieve that goal.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>Communicating with people. I come from roots in graphic design and enjoy conveying ideas to people. Naturally, designing for the web became a necessity and so a few Wrox books later I was well into the world of developing software for the web. Also, programming is fun!</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>A lot. It’s fun to plan out a frame of time and present a topic to a room of people. I like setting the pacing and revealing information to people in a way that can both get them excited and present them with practical knowledge. Mentoring is another great avenue for that. I try very hard to mentor others, as well as find someone to learn from myself. The philosophy of experiential education emphasizes the pattern “see one, do one, teach one”, and I try to keep that active as much as I can.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>Anytime something is produced, learned, improved or passion is rekindled. Shipping viable software or improving it based on features that are in use is an obvious good use of time.</p>
