			Get to Know a Developer: Chris Missal</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/get-to-know-a-developer-chris-missal/2909_85bb896665_quarter" rel="attachment wp-att-3847"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3847" title="Chris Missal" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2909_85bb896665_quarter.png" alt="" width="160" height="160" /></a>Chris Missal, Senior Consultant at Headspring, is our newest addition to the team.  His background is mostly in web development using ASP.NET and MVC in the eCommerce industry.  At his last job, J&amp;P Cycles, he helped create a system for allowing third-party widgets to more clearly communicate with each other, therefore allowing his team to better understand and utilize information picked up from visitors of the site.  Yes, Chris is the guy that knows how to see everything that you see on the internet.  But for good, not for bad!</p>
<p>And his interests don’t stop there.  He’s currently learning Python, and along with coding, he likes disc golf and bowling.  He just moved to Austin from Iowa, and is really looking forward to getting into the social scene.  “The developer community is so lively here that I’ll be looking to get involved with groups that are passionate about making their communities so wonderful,” said Chris.</p>
<p>Here is how the rest of our talk went:</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I feel like somebody probably won’t write a book about something unless they could be considered an expert on the matter. I’ll answer this question by responding to the things that I think I could write a book about. A few things I could picture myself writing about: Unit testing, object-oriented programming and web page markup. Two things I’d love to add to that list that I’m working on is git and JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>I think it would be really to fun to work with the team at GitHub. I think I would have a good time working with people building things like cars that drive themselves, space shuttles, undersea experiments, you know, the usual.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I became interested in technology in grade school while playing video games. As internet shifted more mainstream, I learned that I could play games online. This led me to take an interest in computers and the internet. While I’m not as much of a gamer as I used to be, I’m still very interested in building things that require human interaction. My primary focus is web sites and web applications.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>My first programming language was QBASIC. It started with me tinkering around in the Gorillas game, and not too long later I was writing my own game with sprites and even mouse support! My “gaming career” was short lived and I soon started building simple web pages, learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>I really do like teaching and training people on all sorts of topics. While I might feel outside my comfort zone when it comes to topics that are new to me, the things that I’m really experienced in are quite fun to teach to people. My favorite part of teaching is when I’m asked a really good question. Not only does that help me realize that they’re getting it, but it allows me to adjust and make sure I cover it next time.</p>
<p><strong>Where do begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to libraries and frameworks I usually start with source code, and hopefully on GitHub. Since not everything is open source, I like to use tools like Decompilers to understand what is really going on within the project. Blog posts are also really great to reference. When it comes to methodology and management skills, I prefer hard copy books.</p>

			Becoming a Headspringer: Know Thy ReSharper</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Since I&#8217;m new to Headspring and we are hiring, I thought I would help give an edge to anyone applying and subscribing to our blog. There are many “features” (pun attempted) that make up a Headspringer and I’m hoping my fellow Headspring bloggers will help me verbalize them through the “Becoming a Headspringer” blog series. I will be starting this series with some quick tips on <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>. If you do not already have ReSharper or know what it is, immediately after reading this post is as good a time as any to try it out.</p>
<p>I was assigned my first development project a few weeks ago and was quickly told my hand reached for the mouse too often by Mr. Justin Pope. If you know me at all, you know that I enjoy shortcuts and dislike the mouse quite a bit. In fact, at my previous job, I removed all of my team members’ mice so they would be forced to learn to navigate with the keyboard for a day. So when  I was told I use the mouse too much, I knew I was going to love it at Headspring and thoroughly enjoy becoming a Headspringer. Shortly after a friendly insult, Mr. Justin Pope gave me a quick crash course in many of the common ReSharper shortcuts and I will share some of those shortcuts with you.</p>
<h2>Navigate to a File</h2>
<p>ctrl+n (to navigate to specific type) or ctrl+shift+n (to navigate to a specific file or folder)</p>
<h2>Highlight within File</h2>
<p>ctrl+w (continue pressing w until everything you want highlighted is highlighted)</p>
<h2>Safe Delete</h2>
<p>alt+del (tells you whether or not it’s safe to delete a method, property, class, etc)</p>
<h2>Go to Usages</h2>
<p>ctrl+alt+f7 (shows all usages of a particular method, property, class, etc)</p>
<h2>Parameter information</h2>
<p>ctrl+p (must be just inside parentheses)</p>
<h2>Create Constructor</h2>
<p>1. alt+insert (not just to insert constructor)</p>
<p>2. Select “Constructor” (if you already have fields defined, it will prompt if you want to initialize them)</p>
<h2>Introduce Variable</h2>
<p>1. Highlight what needs to become a variable</p>
<p>2. ctrl+alt+v</p>
<h2>Move Variable to Outer Scope</h2>
<p>1. Navigate near the variable name</p>
<p>2. alt+enter</p>
<p>3. Select “Move to outer scope”</p>
<h2>Create a New Class or File Based on Another</h2>
<p>1. ctrl+n (to navigate to a similar class) or ctrl+shift+n (to navigate to a similar file)</p>
<p>2. alt+shift+l (to navigate to the file in the Solution Explorer)</p>
<p>3. ctrl+c (to copy)</p>
<p>4. ctrl+v (to paste)</p>
<p>5. F2 (to rename)</p>
<p>6. Enter (to open)</p>
<p>7. Start modifying the file</p>
<p align="left">The shortcuts above are a small percentage of the shortcuts I found useful, but a good start to becoming a more productive developer. You may also notice that not all of these are specifically ReSharper shortcuts, some of them are Visual Studio or Windows shortcuts. Anyhow, you can <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Reference__Keyboard_Shortcuts.html">find a more extensive list of ReSharper shortcuts on the Jetbrains site</a>.</p>
<p align="left">As I mentioned above, Headspring is hiring. So if you are interested in being challenged, working with smart people, and being led by a great group of people, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/about-us/careers">apply</a>!</p>

			Creative Leap Year Ideas for the Office</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Because it’s a leap year, we get to take advantage of an extra day of work.  What are you going to do with all the extra time?! Here is a list of great ideas to make February 29th 2012 a day to remember:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Throw a party for your employees, or clients, or both</strong></p>
<p>Let the extra day stand out by throwing a leap year party at your office.  It doesn’t have to be wild; just a little happy hour will do fine.  Invite clients to join in, or keep it just for employees as a special “thank you” for their extra day of work.  Incorporate the party theme with fun ideas, like only playing music that was popular in a previous leap year, or giving prizes for people who create nostalgic costumes from popular fashion in other leap years, and playing games with quarters.</p>
<p><strong>2. Offer something for free</strong></p>
<p>Some companies are creating 25% off door buster promotions for leap year, but nothing beats free.  Host a seminar or a webinar on this extra day, or offer free books and whitepapers.  If you’re business is consulting, consider opening up half the day to help area non-profits and charities with free business advice.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Host an office contest</strong></p>
<p>Office contests are a great way to keep things interesting on an otherwise mundane day at work.  Hold an all day scavenger hunt or a contest that uses the number “4”, like four lines of poetry in four minutes and four-legged races.  If you can’t think of anything fun, split your staff up into teams of four and have them come up with cool contest ideas. Also, consider giving a special bonus or incentive for sales deals that are closed on February 29th.</p>
<p><strong>4. If you’re brave, give your employees the day off</strong></p>
<p>It may seem like a bold move, but what could you lose? Give them the option to take a half day or work from home – especially if the weather is nice.  Show the staff that the extra day is for their families and not work.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get involved with <a href="http://leapyearproject.org/">The Leapyear Project</a></strong></p>
<p>This is a simple startup that is encouraging people to take risks that could change the world this year.  Your business can choose a charitable project, promote it through this movement, and throw a party to celebrate the announcement.  You can also choose to become a corporate sponsor or partner, and assist other leap year projects through time/talent/donations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you do, big or small, don’t let the extra day go unnoticed.  Tell us how your company is using the extra day.</p>

			I Have Framework Commitment Issues</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once upon a time, a problem was identified. Shortly thereafter a solution was found. After all it wasn&#8217;t a tough problem and the solution was simple. A commercial framework was selected and the solution was implemented. Then it was re-implemented with an open source framework and then rolled back to the commercial framework. Both frameworks were evaluated and the findings revealed both frameworks had the features and functionality to solve the problem within the context of the solution. So what was the reason for indecisiveness?</p>
<p>To put it simply, it was a matter of commitment to a license.</p>
<p>Many folks in information technology have to evaluate software because there are typically at least two or more software packages that accomplish similar functions. Think about how many content management systems are available. Or how many virtualization solutions you can pick from. How about web servers? Text editors? Operating systems? The list goes on. In the business of software production we are often faced with similar choices. From selecting the programming languages to build tools, from source control to the integrated development environment (IDE), we are constantly tasked with evaluating things and selecting them. We make choices all the time.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, all the decisions would be as simple as picking the right tool for the job. That&#8217;s where it starts. We start picking the tool for the job. It&#8217;s not a hard thing to do. You eliminate the tools that don&#8217;t work at all. Then you exclude those that only solve part of the problem. You may find yourself with no remaining choices and this complicates things. But generally, you find a few tools that work well. It should be easy to just pick one. Right? A coin toss or a random drawing may seem to be all that is needed. But the fact is - in the real world it&#8217;s not that simple.</p>
<p>Frameworks and software have licenses and the licenses have implications&#8230; and that&#8217;s when you realize, &#8220;I have framework commitment issues&#8221;. How do you overcome these issues when selecting frameworks? It&#8217;s not always easy, but by asking a few questions the selection can become more apparent.</p>
<p><strong>How is the framework supported?</strong></p>
<p>When things go wrong and you need help, who will be there to help fix the problem? Will you have to fix it yourself?</p>
<p>Most open source software support is provided by the community. The community includes you. So aside from yourself, no one is under any obligation to help you. This means you should have the ability and resources to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Commercially licensed frameworks on the other hand usually offer some type of incident support.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it falls on you to make sure your solution works and meets expectations. Neither types of licenses free you from this.</p>
<p><strong>Is the framework proven?</strong></p>
<p>Who is using it and what do they have riding on it? Do some homework and ask around. There are many great commercial and open source frameworks.</p>
<p>If you have a lot riding on the framework you are about to select, you may want to conservatively go with a framework that is tried and true. It&#8217;s a safe bet until you use it in a way that has never been used before, but those situations are rare.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there won&#8217;t be a tried and true framework available. You should still ask around. It is rare to find yourself in a position where you are attempting something completely new that is not even remotely similar to another problem.</p>
<p>While your problem and solution may be unique, it does not imply that there no other problems or solutions that share similar traits.</p>
<p><strong>What resources are available to help you use the framework?</strong></p>
<p>Is there a book? A user group? A conference? Does anyone offer a training course or certification program? How good is the online documentation? Don&#8217;t forget to look for a bundled help file.</p>
<p><strong>What does the framework cost? The total cost?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Commercial software licenses are not free. Some get really expensive. But don&#8217;t let this deter you from purchasing it.</p>
<p>Open source software is free. Sort of. Think about what it may cost to support it in the event you can&#8217;t find any community help.</p>
<p>For either type of license, you are likely to incur cost related to learning the framework. Whether it is a developer&#8217;s time while they research it on the Internet or an intense multi-day certification course, expect to incur some direct and/or indirect cost.</p>
<p>Risk is inevitable. You can minimize this risk by using tried and true frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Should I build my own?</strong></p>
<p>This is the most expensive and riskiest option. Let me state that one more time for good measure&#8230;</p>
<p>This is the most expensive and riskiest option. Sure you won&#8217;t have to worry about a license fee. You can also be certain you will be the one to support it (even if you open source it). Books, training, events, certifications, and similar resources won&#8217;t exist unless you make them (or you open source it and even then it’s not guaranteed).</p>
<p>Avoid rolling your own.</p>
<p><strong>How do I make the commitment?</strong></p>
<p>Pick a framework. As a rule of thumb pick a framework that meets your needs the best (even if it has a significant commercial license fee). If you have few good ones to choose from, consider the questions discussed. If you still can&#8217;t decide&#8230; flip a coin.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Deran Schilling</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Deran Schilling, Senior Consultant at Headspring,  is new to the team, and we have warmly welcomed him in as an additional web technology and design enthusiast.  After working in education for several years at LSU Alexandria, and Clear Creek ISD, Deran has gracefully transitioned to the corporate world and the Austin tech community.  So far, he has lead a team of Headspringers to participate in this year’s <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/headspring-shows-some-love-at-knowbilitys-austin-air">Knowbility Austin AIR</a>, and has plans for more events and competitions this year.  Here is some of our conversation:</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>In high school, I planned to be a band director, but ended up in a programming class my senior year.  From that point on, I was going to be a developer.  Lucky for me the college I chose has a great music program and CIS program.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Yes I do.  In my previous jobs, I would always offer up different training sessions from MVC to jQuery to SQL to CSS to whatever they asked to learn about.  I firmly believe that you don’t fully understand something until you can teach it.  Occasionally, I call some of my developer friends to tell them about something new I learned.  In the conversation, I can determine if I really understand it.  If they ask a lot of questions that I can’t answer, I know I need to learn more.  Hopefully they don’t read this post and know they’re my guinea pigs.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on what I’m learning because I have different approaches for various things, but if we’re talking about a new technology then I gauge my co-workers and some reviews on whether or not it’s even worth learning.  If it is, I’ll jump into Google and find some blog posts.  If I can’t find any blog posts, I’ll buy the book.   If there is no book, I’ll figure it out myself and then blog about it.  This way, there will be a post that other people and myself can reference.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent?”</strong></p>
<p>I gauge it based on how much value was brought to the company or to a relationship.  I value the time in the break room or at our lunches because carefully built relationships are important to a healthy team.  One of the main reasons I wanted to come to Headspring is because they seem very people-oriented.  We all work out of the Headspring office, which I think makes for a stronger team, and we are involved in the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			Detached HEAD State</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, I was investigating a pretty intricate bug, and wanted to determine whether it was introduced recently or had always been present.  I wanted to revert my workspace to an old commit to see if the problem could be reproduced there.  If not, I&#8217;d be well on my way to finding the Guilty Commit That Broke Things.  When I tried to jump back in time like this, I was presented with an unusually verbose warning message that helped to fill in a gap of my understanding of git.</p>
<p>With git, you switch between branches by issuing the command <code>git checkout branchname</code>.  Branches are just convenient nicknames for commits, though, so I knew that you could also switch to any commit using the commit&#8217;s ID.  I tried <code>git checkout 77cdf</code> and was surprised by the following message:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;
Note: checking out &#39;77cdf&#39;.

You are in &#39;detached HEAD&#39; state.  You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again.  Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 77cdf...
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<h2>Branches and HEAD</h2>
<p>Before breaking this down, let&#8217;s review a few basics.  Git commits each have an ID number.  Git branches are convenient nicknames for commits.  A branch points at a single commit by remember its ID number.  Git also has a special pointer called HEAD which represents your current location in the potentially-large database of commits.</p>
<p>Almost all of the time, HEAD points at (&#8220;is attached to&#8221;) some branch.  HEAD points at your branch, and the branch points at a commit ID, so when you ask git &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;, git knows the commit you are at as well as its user-facing nickname.  <strong>When HEAD points at a branch that points at the current commit, and you make a new commit, HEAD and the branch follow you to the new commit.</strong>  Even when you&#8217;re in a fresh repository and haven&#8217;t made any branches yet, the default branch named &#8216;master&#8217; fills this same role.</p>
<p>I understood that much before trying to <code>git checkout 77cdf</code>, but I expected no warning, and I expected that this would put me into a read-only state since no branches were involved.  I was so used to the idea that branches are <em>always involved</em> during the act of committing, and figured that without a branch, a new commit would be meaningless.</p>
<h2>Breaking Down the Warning</h2>
<p><strong>You are in &#8216;detached HEAD&#8217; state.</strong>  HEAD almost always points at a branch, which points at the current commit.  When you jump back in time to a commit that has no branch pointed at it, HEAD is no longer attached to a branch.  HEAD still lets you and git know where you are, but we no longer have an answer to the question &#8220;What user-facing nickname describes where I am?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them&#8230;</strong>  This surprised me.  Without a branch name to follow me to the next commit, what would it even <em>mean</em> to commit?  Later on, I&#8217;d need a nice nickname for any new commits, so my repository viewer could know to show them to me at all, right?  If I commit from here right now, wouldn&#8217;t I just forget the ID later on when I wanted to find it again?</p>
<p>Working with HEAD attached to a branch had influenced my mental image of what it means to make a commit; I was so used to the idea of a branch following you along that I mistook them for two parts of the same action.  In reality, creating a commit and having the branch name follow you are two distinct acts.  You can create a commit without having a branch follow you to the new state.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.</strong> AHA!  If I make several commits in this state, I <em>do</em> blaze a new nameless trail, and jumping away from that trail without first giving it a name will effectively discard my work (it&#8217;s still there, but surely you&#8217;ll forget the ID).  No harm, no foul.  Just an experiment.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again.</strong> Double-AHA!  If I start blazing a nameless trail as an experiment, and then I realize that I don&#8217;t want to discard it after all, I can give it a name.  Interestingly, you can give it a name using the exact same command that you would use to create a feature branch off of master: <code>git checkout -b newbranchname</code>.  This makes sense.  When I&#8217;m on master during normal development and issue this command to create a branch, I&#8217;m really just saying &#8220;Oh by the way, the current commit is now ALSO known as newbranchname, and <em>that</em> name should start following me.&#8221;</p>
<p>To sum up, detached HEAD state is a sharp tool.  Use it to inspect an old commit, or to perform an experiment using an old commit as a starting point.  Be sure to give that new work a name as soon as it stops being experimental.</p>

			How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Data Tier</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At some point in 2005 or so, I started using ORMs to perform data access to a RDBMS. ORMs solved a lot of problems I was running into as a developer, namely all the boring ADO.NET code to deal with reading data and populating objects. Previously, my data mapping strategy was something like writing a bunch of stored procedures and corresponding ADO.NET code that is hard to write and even harder to maintain.</p>
<p>I would wind up with a lot of code dealing with DBNull and such, but not much of the code dealt with actually reading information out. It was annoying. It was easy to get wrong. In my attempt to rid myself of this kind of code, I ditched all the things that SQL Server does well.</p>
<p>Using an ORM, especially with databases with large amounts of data, does not preclude the developer from learning these systems. It’s one thing to say we’re ditching Stored Procedures, but yet another to ignore all of the other things that RDBMS does well, and can very much impact the end-user experience of a system.</p>
<p>I had ditched a lot of things in SQL Server when going to ORMs, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Indexes</li>
<li>Custom SQL projections</li>
<li>Aggregation</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190766.aspx">Common Table Expressions</a> (CTEs)</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, all of the things that make RDBMS work well. It wasn’t the ORM that forced me down this path. It was my own bias.</p>
<p>Recently, we hit an issue where we were wanting to enforce uniqueness of the member’s email in the system. We had a set of code on a user creating an account:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1871924.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This worked well when only one user tried to save their email at any given time. But in a messaging system, we often do things like increase throughput by increasing workers. But that introduces the problem of dirty reads. If between the time the system checks the database for uniqueness and finally saves the member, that email could (and did) sneak in.</p>
<p>So how did we solve this? Not by removing this code, but putting in a unique constraint and an index on that column. Now I’ve <em>guaranteed</em> uniqueness for that value, instead of having just a hope that the value is unique. It’s something that the database does, and does well. So instead of worrying about logic in SQL stored procedures, which I won’t do, I’ll look at what SQL does well, and take advantage of those features as necessary.</p>
<p>It’s the same side of the coin of “use the right tool for the job”. It’s “be aware of what tools work best in what scenarios, and tradeoffs for those scenarios.”</p>

			Are User Groups and Conferences Worth My Time?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I guess I would consider myself an events butterfly. There is not a week that goes by that I do not attend a user group, special interest group, conference or unconference, networking event or some other form of peer to peer learning and networking.</p>
<p>I was recently asked if going to all of these events was really worth the time. My answer to them is the answer I give to everyone. There is always one person you will have a conversation with, one speaker giving a presentation, or one bit of information that makes the time completely worth it. If nothing else, you usually get a free drink or some food out of it. But in all seriousness, I cannot express enough the importance of attending these events.</p>
<p>I am not saying that it is valuable for an individual to attend every event that is going on within a 20 mile radius. I do think it is key to pick groups and events that are not only crucial for the industry your company represents, but also the groups that will help you with your career.</p>
<p>This past weekend I attended Austin ProductCamp, a semiannual event for product managers and product marketers. A message they have consistently reminded all attendees of is “a meeting is only what you make of it”. They suggest instead of messing around with your phone during session breaks, take advantage of your peers that are there to learn more too. Instead of only exchanging business cards be sure to follow up with people. It doesn’t count to just go home and connect with them on LinkedIn. Instead of staying in a session that isn&#8217;t giving you what you need, use your two feet (the two foot rule at ProductCamp) and go to a different session.</p>
<p>Even though ProductCamp is making these recommendations, their lessons and practices can be used to make all events you attend worth your time. What are you looking to get out of the events you attend?</p>

			Improve Your LINQ With .Any()</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>LINQ&#8217;s <code>.Any()</code> method is under-utilized, given the benefits it brings in making your code briefer, clearer, and more efficient. LINQ in general improves the expressiveness of your collection-manipulating code by using declarative statements instead of imperative <code>foreach</code> loops; <code>.Any()</code> is a great tool in that regard.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a representative example:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1877234.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>I want to determine if my to-do list has any items that are late, so I use <code>.Where()</code> to filter my list of deliverables down to items with a deadline in the past; then I take a <code>.Count()</code> of the resulting list, and see if that number is greater than zero. This is a plausible solution, and our years of SQL lead us to write LINQ this way. But it can be better.</p>
<p>Testing &#8220;count greater than zero&#8221; is a programmer&#8217;s way of saying &#8220;are there any?&#8221; So let&#8217;s just say <em>any</em>. As you might expect, <code>.Any()</code> returns a Boolean indicating whether the collection contains any items. Further, you can pass a lambda expression to specify the predicate &#8220;any <em>like this</em>.&#8221; (<code>.Count()</code> takes a predicate, too, by the way, but I really have seen &#8221;<code>.Where().Count()</code>&#8221; in use, so I wanted to start from there.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the new version:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1877236.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In addition to being shorter, this version more directly and declaratively states my intent: &#8220;Are there any late deliverables?&#8221;</p>
<p>This code also executes more efficiently. For <code>.Count()</code> to return a value, LINQ must iterate over all items in the collection, even though I don&#8217;t care <em>how many</em> items there are. <code>.Any()</code> will return as soon as it encounters an item that satisfies the predicate. It evaluates as few items as possible, giving me an efficient and readable solution.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Nolan Egly</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3646" title="nolan egly" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/nolan-egly-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" />This week I was pleased to sit down and chat with Nolan Egly, our newest Senior Consultant at Headspring.  Nolan has been working as a software developer in Austin for years.  He was hired here at Headspring after being placed on our famous internal spreadsheet that lists our employees’ “dream” coworkers.  That is, if you could work with anyone, who would it be? Apparently it’s Nolan! </p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I’m an expert debugger, thanks in large part to being patient and ruthlessly methodical and organized while troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I got a TI 99-4A computer when I was a kid, and got hooked on programming simple games in BASIC.  There was just a sense of magic in getting the computer to do my bidding, once you can figure out how to instruct it.  As I got older I could see how computer programs make people’s lives better in so many different ways, and who can walk away from doing something you find fun that makes life better?</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy helping others, and teaching is really just a specialized form of helping by expanding someone’s knowledge of how things work.  The biggest reward is seeing that “aha” moment in others when it all comes together, it’s just like seeing a set of instructions you’ve put together do something useful on a computer.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I usually try a blend of hands on practice and academic study of the fundamentals, whether it’s a new programming language or a new craft like cake baking. Hands on practice and study is important – we learn from failures, and practice makes concepts real to us.  Rote memorization doesn’t stick if you don’t exercise what you’re learning.  Hands on practice also needs to be supplemented with a sound understanding of the theoretical underpinnings, or else you won’t completely understand the “whys” of what you’re doing, or be able to see new ways to accomplish things.</p>
<p><strong>When is the best time to test?</strong></p>
<p>When you are building some sort of high risk functionality. Something is high risk if the consequences of failure are high – security rules, for example. Something is also high risk if the chance of introducing a defect later is high. A few examples of this would be complex business rules, long multistep calculations, or conditional logic. I’m sure there is a lot more testing in, say, the aerospace industry, than in others. It all depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nolan went on to explain to me that he is the kind of person that is incredibly meticulous.  He posed the question, “Would you allow a computer you programmed to operate on you? I might; I don’t know. I just know that I am the kind of person that is going to be really diligent and meticulous about the details, just in case.”</p>
