			Get to Know a Developer: Patrick McVeety-Mill</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/photo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5718" title="Patrick McVeety-Mill" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/photo-224x300.jpg" alt="Patrick McVeety-Mill" width="224" height="300" /></a>Patrick McVeety-Mill is one of a kind here at Headspring. We found him pretty much straight out of college, but his resume and <a href="http://loudandabrasive.com/">portfolio</a> showed a lot of potential.  We’ve never hired a fresh graduate before, but he’s proven to encompass every ounce of thoughtfulness, creativity and skill we have come to expect from a seasoned developer.  After a few weeks on the job, I’m convinced!</p>
<p>Patrick is a native Austinite, but graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in Game Design and Development. We’ll forgive him.</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing that I can think of; maybe frying eggs. I do have some skill in c# and some other programming know-how. I’m pretty good at game design and storytelling, too.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoy developing games but it was never my intention to pursue it as a career. I like programming and the constant creation and adoption of new technology fascinates me. The client-facing side of software development always appealed to me and it seemed like a good field to put both my programming and communication skills to good use.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>When I got to college I had barely used a computer aside from playing games and word processing. I started off in Java but very quickly moved to c# and then later c++. The progression of languages went hand-in-hand with learning more about software and web design, fun theory, and fancy algorithms that games use.</p>
<p>I remember going to the computer lab in elementary school and playing around with this program called &#8220;HyperStudio.&#8221; It was like a primitive blend of Flash Studio and PowerPoint. You could set up little interactive clipart objects and link between pages and animate things. I used it to make goofy little point-and-click adventure games. It was a lot of fun and my first exposure to digital interactive design, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. I worked at a dining hall in college and it was a lot of fun to train people on everything from how to make a good rueben to mopping floors. Of course more intellectually stimulating things are fun to teach, too. Not that making a good rueben isn’t intellectually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>Where do begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I usually start by asking folks I know: coworkers, buddies, former professors and classmates. People are a good resource since they can elaborate or adapt their explanation on the fly, whereas books are more static. That being said, I always ask about the best books on a topic and follow through with those.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>Productivity can be a tough thing to gauge, especially when people disagree on what “production” entails.  For me, as long as I’m learning something, making something, or building a relationship with those involved in the producing, I feel it’s time well spent. And even better spent if I can do all those at once.</p>

			Headspring & 1st Down Technologies Launch App That Delivers Complete Playbook Tool for Youth League Coaches and Players</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>AUSTIN, TX – Sept, 2012,</strong> Headspring, an Austin-based software development company, today announced the launch of FirstDown PlayBook™ Youth, a football app for mobile and tablet devices developed for 1st Down Technologies, LLC, an Austin-based sports software company.</p>
<p>FirstDown PlayBook™ Youth app is a tool for youth league football coaches and players to browse formation packs full of professionally drawn plays, create playbooks, and develop practice and game plans. The app also allows users to print the coach’s playbook and player wristband sheets.  Using HTML5 technology, the playbook is web-based and gives coaches and players immediate access on multiple mobile and tablet devices. Real-time changes can be made offline during football games and updated online when an Internet connection is available. </p>
<p>“Working with the team at 1st Down Technologies on this innovative football app has been a lot of fun,” said Kevin Hurwitz, chief architect of Headspring. “By creating the program with HTML5 versus iOS, the technology is compatible on virtually all mobile and tablet devices, which allows flexibility and caters to the different platforms used by coaches and players.”</p>
<p>Coach Charlie Coiner, 27-year veteran at both the NFL and NCAA levels, and current assistant coach of a division one NCAA football team, founded 1st Down Technologies in 2011.  His goal was to help coaches at all levels spend more time developing youth football players and less time consumed with designing plays.

			A C# Feature That Shocks the Conscience</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The &#8220;default arguments&#8221; feature in C# seems like a great time-saver at first, but there is a sharp difference between what it <em>feels</em> like it does versus what it <em>actually</em> does which can lead to surprises.  Recently, fellow Headspring consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/pedroreys">Pedro Reys</a> discovered a particularly bizarre gotcha related to default arguments.</p>
<h2>Default Arugments Provide Brevity</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the pain that default arguments are meant to solve.  When overloading a method, we often do so because some arguments aren&#8217;t always required or because some arguments have a reasonable default that you don&#8217;t want to make consumers explicitly write again and again:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456037.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Here, we don&#8217;t want to make the consumer <em>always</em> specify the argument when a reasonable default exists.  When you want to specify a value, you can.  We have one overload simply call the other in order to avoid repeating ourselves.  Despite trying to avoid repeating ourselves, we really still have duplicated a few lines and a handful of characters of code here.  Enter default arguments:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456047.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>What Really Happens</h2>
<p>This seems like a great little addition to the language.  It <em>feels</em> like the compiler is going to react to this by effectively writing the simple overload for me.  Unfortunately, including a default value does something else entirely.  Instead of &#8220;writing my overload for me&#8221;, the compiler <em>alters the call sites</em> that make use of this method, effectively copying-and-pasting a <code>null</code> whenever we call the method.</p>
<p>In simple scenarios, this distinction doesn&#8217;t matter.  The moment it does matter, though, you are going to be surprised.</p>
<h2>Interfaces Allow Contradictory Defaults</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;ve got some classes that perform an operation against an input int:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456058.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Ok, no surprises yet.  When we omitted the argument in the first call, the compiler copied and pasted a 1 into the call site.</p>
<p>As we start adding more and more such operations to the program, a developer finds a need to extract a common interface for all such one-argument operations.  This developer means well, but when he writes the interface definition, he doesn&#8217;t look at each and every implementing class&#8217;s defaults.  He figures 0 is a reasonable default for an integer, and defines it like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456065.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><em>Note that the default in the interface is different from the defaults on the concrete classes.</em></p>
<p>Running the same sample code produces the same output as before:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456075.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This makes sense.  We&#8217;re calling <code>Negate.Apply</code>, and <code>Negate.Apply</code>&#8217;s default comes into play just like before.  We might (incorrectly!) conclude that the concrete runtime type (<code>Negate</code>) is used to determine which default value &#8220;wins&#8221; the competition.</p>
<p>Later, a new developer joins the project.  He is unaware that the interface and concrete classes have conflicting defaults.  He&#8217;s read up on SOLID principles and naturally he wants to favor abstract types over concrete types.  He makes one seemingly-safe change to the code, changing only the declared type of the <code>operation</code> variable:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456080.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The C# compiler finds our efforts to apply &#8220;nonbreaking changes&#8221; quaint but ultimately futile.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What in the <em>what!?</em></h2>
<p>The runtime type of <code>operation</code> is the same as in the previous execution, and that type oh-so-clearly defines its own default as 1.  However, <strong>the selection of which method will actually run is a separate decision from the selection of which default value gets copy/pasted to the call site.</strong>  Default value selection is based on the compile-time type of <code>operation</code> (<code>IUnaryOperation</code>), because the copy/paste <em>happens</em> at compile time.  The selection of which method needs to execute happens at runtime, upon inspecting the actual type of <code>operation</code> (<code>Negate</code>).</p>
<p>In order to use default values well, you have to constantly think about how they were implemented.  That&#8217;s enough to make you want to completely avoid this feature.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still willing to use default arguments, with one simple rule of thumb: <strong>pretend that you may only ever use a default value of 0, null, or false; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/83fhsxwc(v=vs.80).aspx">the same defaults</a> we already expect for otherwise-uninitialized variables.</strong>  If we always use these predictable defaults, we can avoid verbose overload definitions while being confident that we won&#8217;t have our explicit defaults ignored at runtime.</p>

			Quashing Incidental Complexity</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This post is the conclusion to a 7-part series on identifying and resolving incidental complexity in your software projects.  It assumes you&#8217;ve already read the earlier posts (linked in the sections below).</p>
<p>The problems I&#8217;ve faced can crop up in any project.  When a concept or responsibility gets applied to the wrong abstraction, we subconsciously start to add workarounds just to make things work at all.  These workarounds take up space, physically as excess lines of code and mentally as distractions from your true intent.  Workarounds beget workarounds, and the problem feeds itself until you think, &#8220;What a mess!  I need to rewrite it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>By placing responsibilities in their proper home, you can combat this feedback loop and keep your code clean.</p>
<h2>A Troubled Project</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/essential-vs-incidental-complexity/">Essential vs Incidental Complexity</a>, I admitted that my pet project, a compiler for an experimental language called <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook">Rook</a>, was starting to run into problems.</p>
<p>In a healthy project, it can actually get easier to add new features the further along you go, as you discover and flesh out abstractions that help rather than hinder progress.  In Rook, it was getting harder and harder to add new features.  This difficulty was a sign that I was working with the wrong abstractions.</p>
<p>Two classes in particular were starting to grow wildly complex: Scope (a dictionary-like type that describes which identifiers are visible from the point of view of a line of input source code), and TypeChecker (a recursive process which determines the type of all expressions).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m pretty good at writing software, but here I am admitting I created something too complex for its own good.  <strong>This can happen to anyone</strong>.  The important thing to know is that you can always take steps to turn things around.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s tempting to chuck everything and embark on a rewrite, but I&#8217;ve done that before (with this project!) and I&#8217;d rather fix what I have over the course of a few <em>weeks</em> than rewrite it and find myself in the same spot in a few <em>years</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This kind of problem has a direct connection to incidental complexity.  If your abstractions are working against you, you spend more lines of code serving them than they spend serving you.  It starts to get harder and harder to see the intent behind a given method because half of the characters in it amount to boilerplate. </p>
<p>As I said, this can happen to anyone.  The solution is to identify which abstractions are faulty, and adjust them in small and safe increments until they start working for you again.  </p>
<p>Faulty abstractions can take many forms:</p>
<h2>Unnecessary Abstractions</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/identifying-incidental-complexity/">Identifying Incidental Complexity</a>, TypeChecked&lt;T&gt; was an abstraction that complicated things without adding anything of value.  Its existence required many methods in TypeChecker to waste a lot of time and concentration to recombine very small arrays of error messages, completely distracting the reader from the actual intent of the methods.  It ultimately gave me no benefit, and removing it helped to clean up a lot of ugly code.</p>
<h2>Abstractions with Multiple Personalities</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/scope-creep/">Scope Creep</a>, we saw that the Scope abstraction was right in its inception but had gotten extremely complicated over time.</p>
<p>One class absorbed many responsibilities as I began to use it in more and more scenarios.  In fact, I was using one Scope class to represent several different <em>kinds</em> of scope (global, local, etc).  The Scope class had multiple personalities, and I saw that splitting such a class into several classes with a common interface would make it easier to see the actual domain concepts I was trying to represent.</p>
<p>Specifically, I used inheritance and lots of <code>override</code> methods to accomplish this improvement.  I don&#8217;t enjoy doing that, but implementation inhertiance in this case was a <em>tool</em> to nudge things in the right direction in small steps while solidifying what separate classes I needed.</p>
<h2>Brittle Abstractions</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/spaghetti-alla-code/">Spaghetti alla Code</a>, we saw how implementation inheritance can motivate some horribly convoluted code that just <em>happens</em> to work.  Scope was separated <em>physically</em> into different classes now, but the method implementations were all tied up in knots.</p>
<p>With lots of <code>virtual/override/base</code> keywords, you have to read <em>all</em> of the code to understand <em>any</em> of the code.  Making changes here without unintended side effects becomes too difficult, making the abstraction brittle in the face of inevitable change.</p>
<blockquote><p>Implementation inheritance is like writing in assembly language: it <em>works</em>, but good luck ever <em>editing</em> it with confidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>The solution here was to favor composition over inheritance.  Each individual class can be understood by only looking at that class.  The new implementations read a lot more like an English description of the domain being modeled.</p>
<h2>Anemic Abstractions</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/primitive-obsession/">Primitive Obsession</a>, I had an abstraction that existed in name only: TypeVariable was a simple wrapper for an int.  I was so obsessed that the TypeVariable class was &#8220;just a glorified int&#8221; that it never occurred to me to put more smarts into it.</p>
<p>Not realizing that this class was a good home for some important concepts, I had to throw those concepts <em>anywhere</em> that would work, and that just happened to be the unfortunate Scope class mentioned before (as if it didn&#8217;t have enough to worry about).</p>
<blockquote><p>Scope was a bit of an Idea Sponge at this point.</p></blockquote>
<p>The solution was to recognize that the TypeVariable abstraction was incomplete, and lots of things got simpler once an appropriate responsibility moved into the TypeVariable class.</p>
<h2>Complected Abstractions</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/detect-reflect-decomplect/">Detect, Reflect, Decomplect</a>, we saw that when two separate ideas get complected (braided) together, we have to start writing extra code to work around that complexity.</p>
<p>I was twisting up success and failure results into a single return value, forcing me to place special meaning on <em>null</em>s, and to include excessive early return statements throughout many methods.  These extra return statements set the code in intellectual concrete, severely limiting my ability to apply any cleanup refactorings.</p>
<p>By untwisting the concepts of success and failure in this class, and by avoiding null with the Null Object pattern, the troubled TypeChecker class finally got <em>linear</em> enough to have a hope of ever getting cleaned up.</p>
<h2>Code is Too Malleable to be Intractable</h2>
<p>When you find the complexity of your projects growing out of control, don&#8217;t lose hope!  Take a step back, identify which abstractions you&#8217;re doing <em>extra</em> work <em>for</em>, and nudge them in small and safe steps until they better-represent the Truth of your domain.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even have to put forward progress on hold; these kinds of improvements can be a small part of your daily activities.</p>
<p>Make your life easier and your project healthier by growing and cultivating abstractions that let you write <em>less and less</em> code.</p>
