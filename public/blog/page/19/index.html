  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I was investigating a pretty intricate bug, and wanted to determine whether it was introduced recently or had always been present.  I wanted to revert my workspace to an old commit to see if the problem could be reproduced there.  If not, I&#8217;d be well on my way to finding the Guilty Commit That Broke Things.  When I tried to jump back in time like this, I was presented with an unusually verbose warning message that helped to fill in a gap of my understanding of git.<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At some point in 2005 or so, I started using ORMs to perform data access to a RDBMS. ORMs solved a lot of problems I was running into as a developer, namely all the boring ADO.NET code to deal with reading data and populating objects. Previously, my data mapping strategy was something like writing a bunch of stored procedures and corresponding ADO.NET code that is hard to write and even harder to maintain.</p>
<p>I would wind up with a lot of code dealing with DBNull and such, but not much of the code dealt with actually reading information out. It was annoying. It was easy to get wrong. In my attempt to rid myself of this kind of code, I ditched all the things that SQL Server does well.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>LINQ&#8217;s <code>.Any()</code> method is under-utilized, given the benefits it brings in making your code briefer, clearer, and more efficient. LINQ in general improves the expressiveness of your collection-manipulating code by using declarative statements instead of imperative <code>foreach</code> loops; <code>.Any()</code> is a great tool in that regard.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a representative example:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1877234.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>I want to determine if my to-do list has any items that are late, so I use <code>.Where()</code> to filter my list of deliverables down to items with a deadline in the past; then I take a <code>.Count()</code> of the resulting list, and see if that number is greater than zero. This is a plausible solution, and our years of SQL lead us to write LINQ this way. But it can be better.</div>

Apparently it’s Nolan! </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At a previous job, I worked for a company that used Subversion for all of its projects.  This was a welcome change coming from a TFS and Visual Source Safe background.</p>
<p>We did relatively little work with branches.  For the most part, a branch was created only to represent the state we wanted to deploy to production.  In other words, everybody worked against trunk, and when we were happy with what we had we would create a branch with the version number as its name, and we would deploy from there.  If a hotfix was needed, at least we didn&#8217;t have to worry about deploying it along with incomplete features under development; we&#8217;d base the hotfix on the version branch and deploy that.</p>
<p>On one occasion, someone needed to make a fairly drastic change to the system.  It was a little risky, and would have interfered with the rest of the team if it was performed against trunk, so they made a feature branch for it.  About a month later, I was tasked with merging that back into trunk.</p>
<p><strong>This was, shall we say, an Interesting Merge.</strong><br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just in time for Valentine’s Day, three Headspring consultants competed in the annual Austin Accessibility Internet Rally (Austin AIR) hosted by <a href="http://www.knowbility.org/">Knowbility.org</a>.  Knowbility&#8217;s website explains the goal of the rally is &#8220;to teach participating web developers and designers about the tools and techniques necessary to make the web accessible to everyone – including people with disabilities.&#8221;  In addition, participating nonprofits benefit by receiving professional help to build a new or replace an existing site.  Judging for the competition lasts a couple weeks, and the winner is announced at an awards ceremony in March.</p>
<p>Headspring-ers Anne Epstein, Mahendra Mavani and Deran Schilling showed up bright and early Saturday morning  to form their team, calling themselves the Headspring Hurwitzes (a tribute to our reigning Chief Architect, Kevin Hurwitz). They were assigned to Texas TERA with a mission to breathe life into their stale, outdated website.</p>

You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/maydaytx/DynamicLinq">Github</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, he is incredibly knowledgeable Headspring developer, and is known for his affinity for clean, elegant code.  In fact, he prefers refactoring rather than having to work around bad code.  He is also great proponent for balancing the benefit of tests without sacrificing quality.  Here’s what else I learned today:</p>

<p>Most of my recent experience has been with subversion, so I have been <em>unlearning</em> that as much as I have been <em>learning</em> git.  The most apparent difference right away is what it really means to make a &quot;commit&quot;.<br />
