			Seamless Audit Trails in RavenDB</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Since the basic product sold by software consultancies is consultant-time, you would expect there to be pressure (gentle or not), to put in as many billable hours as physically possible, to the detrement of quality.  Fortunately, Headspring takes the long view: excess hours this week may make this week&#8217;s revenue numbers jump, but sustainability matters more for all involved.  I first experienced this policy as a reliable 40 hour work week, but it doesn&#8217;t stop there.  When you take the long view, you respect the need to put some unbillable time towards improving your own skills.  This week, I got to take advantage of that flexibility by attending Headspring&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.headspring.com/events/ravendb-boot-camp/">RavenDB Boot Camp</a>, taught by <a href="http://coderwall.com/alonsorobles">Alonso Robles</a>.</p>
<p>When new software tools come around, they almost always claim to &#8220;Just Work&#8221;.  Even <a href="http://ravendb.net/">ravendb.net</a> makes this claim.  Real software problems tend to involve lots of competing concerns, so we should always take such claims with a grain of salt in addition to an open mind.  During the Boot Camp, I got to see a perfect example of where this &#8220;It Just Works&#8221; claim comes from.</p>
<p>RavenDB supports plugins called <a href="http://ravendb.net/docs/server/bundles">bundles</a>.  Bundles are installed by dropping a DLL into the Plugins folder beside the server exe.  One of the bundles demonstrated during the Boot Camp was for <a href="http://ravendb.net/docs/server/bundles/versioning">Versioning writes and deletions</a>.  This bundle has quite-reasonable default behavior, so installation is just a matter of dropping the DLL into the Plugins folder.</p>
<p>We students didn&#8217;t know exactly how this audit trail would present itself to us.  How would we find the trail, inspect its contents, or revert to some older state?  To find out, we dropped the bundle in its new home and started creating and updating documents through Raven&#8217;s admin tool.  There was a collective, audible &#8220;AHA!&#8221; moment among all the students.  We were updating a document whose ID was &#8220;products/4&#8221;, and right beside it in the admin tool&#8217;s list of related documents, we started to see &#8220;products/4/revisions/1&#8221;, &#8220;products/4/revisions/2&#8221;, &#8220;products/4/revisions/3&#8221;&#8230;  A full copy of the document was being stored upon each change.</p>
<p>The unit of storage of your primary data in Raven is Just Some Document, so why not also store the audit trail as Just Some More Documents?  A completely-understandable naming convention and a little metadata is all we need to work with.  Of course, the bundle also lets you fetch the revision history from your own application, and reverting to an older state would simply be a matter of fetching the revision you want and saving it again.  <strong>The beauty here lies in how the bundle leverages Raven&#8217;s world view.</strong>  Implementing an audit trail didn&#8217;t require some fundamental change to the way Raven works, and we didn&#8217;t have to roll our own audit trail by increasing complexity in our client application.  Instead, it just used the existing Raven infrastructure.</p>
<p>Earlier, I warned that &#8220;It Just Works&#8221; claims need to stand up to competing concerns.  By allowing for this kind of low-impact behavior change, adding a Versioning feature to our application doesn&#8217;t have to compete with the rest of our application&#8217;s concerns.  We didn&#8217;t have to make some painful, sweeping change everywhere our client touched the database, and the opportunity to add a history viewer to the application itself was readily available.</p>
<p>One is an extremely small sample size, so I&#8217;ll need to experience more of these &#8220;AHA!&#8221; moments, but this does suggest that the deliberately-simple mental model promoted by Raven leaves the door open for us to seamlessly introduce features into our projects.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Patrick McVeety-Mill</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/photo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5718" title="Patrick McVeety-Mill" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/photo-224x300.jpg" alt="Patrick McVeety-Mill" width="224" height="300" /></a>Patrick McVeety-Mill is one of a kind here at Headspring. We found him pretty much straight out of college, but his resume and <a href="http://loudandabrasive.com/">portfolio</a> showed a lot of potential.  We’ve never hired a fresh graduate before, but he’s proven to encompass every ounce of thoughtfulness, creativity and skill we have come to expect from a seasoned developer.  After a few weeks on the job, I’m convinced!</p>
<p>Patrick is a native Austinite, but graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in Game Design and Development. We’ll forgive him.</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing that I can think of; maybe frying eggs. I do have some skill in c# and some other programming know-how. I’m pretty good at game design and storytelling, too.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoy developing games but it was never my intention to pursue it as a career. I like programming and the constant creation and adoption of new technology fascinates me. The client-facing side of software development always appealed to me and it seemed like a good field to put both my programming and communication skills to good use.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>When I got to college I had barely used a computer aside from playing games and word processing. I started off in Java but very quickly moved to c# and then later c++. The progression of languages went hand-in-hand with learning more about software and web design, fun theory, and fancy algorithms that games use.</p>
<p>I remember going to the computer lab in elementary school and playing around with this program called &#8220;HyperStudio.&#8221; It was like a primitive blend of Flash Studio and PowerPoint. You could set up little interactive clipart objects and link between pages and animate things. I used it to make goofy little point-and-click adventure games. It was a lot of fun and my first exposure to digital interactive design, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. I worked at a dining hall in college and it was a lot of fun to train people on everything from how to make a good rueben to mopping floors. Of course more intellectually stimulating things are fun to teach, too. Not that making a good rueben isn’t intellectually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>Where do begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I usually start by asking folks I know: coworkers, buddies, former professors and classmates. People are a good resource since they can elaborate or adapt their explanation on the fly, whereas books are more static. That being said, I always ask about the best books on a topic and follow through with those.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>Productivity can be a tough thing to gauge, especially when people disagree on what “production” entails.  For me, as long as I’m learning something, making something, or building a relationship with those involved in the producing, I feel it’s time well spent. And even better spent if I can do all those at once.</p>

			Headspring & 1st Down Technologies Launch App That Delivers Complete Playbook Tool for Youth League Coaches and Players</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>AUSTIN, TX – Sept, 2012,</strong> Headspring, an Austin-based software development company, today announced the launch of FirstDown PlayBook™ Youth, a football app for mobile and tablet devices developed for 1st Down Technologies, LLC, an Austin-based sports software company.</p>
<p>FirstDown PlayBook™ Youth app is a tool for youth league football coaches and players to browse formation packs full of professionally drawn plays, create playbooks, and develop practice and game plans. The app also allows users to print the coach’s playbook and player wristband sheets.  Using HTML5 technology, the playbook is web-based and gives coaches and players immediate access on multiple mobile and tablet devices. Real-time changes can be made offline during football games and updated online when an Internet connection is available. </p>
<p>“Working with the team at 1st Down Technologies on this innovative football app has been a lot of fun,” said Kevin Hurwitz, chief architect of Headspring. “By creating the program with HTML5 versus iOS, the technology is compatible on virtually all mobile and tablet devices, which allows flexibility and caters to the different platforms used by coaches and players.”</p>
<p>Coach Charlie Coiner, 27-year veteran at both the NFL and NCAA levels, and current assistant coach of a division one NCAA football team, founded 1st Down Technologies in 2011.  His goal was to help coaches at all levels spend more time developing youth football players and less time consumed with designing plays. For more information about 1st Down Technologies, visit <a href="http://www.firstdownapp.com/">www.firstdownapp.com</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to launch this app just in time for football season,” said Keith German, Business Operations Executive of 1st Down Technologies. “The Headspring team was instrumental in making our vision a reality.  The entire process was seamless and we are excited to offer an app that will help take youth football coaching and player development to new levels.”</p>

			A C# Feature That Shocks the Conscience</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The &#8220;default arguments&#8221; feature in C# seems like a great time-saver at first, but there is a sharp difference between what it <em>feels</em> like it does versus what it <em>actually</em> does which can lead to surprises.  Recently, fellow Headspring consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/pedroreys">Pedro Reys</a> discovered a particularly bizarre gotcha related to default arguments.</p>
<h2>Default Arugments Provide Brevity</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the pain that default arguments are meant to solve.  When overloading a method, we often do so because some arguments aren&#8217;t always required or because some arguments have a reasonable default that you don&#8217;t want to make consumers explicitly write again and again:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456037.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Here, we don&#8217;t want to make the consumer <em>always</em> specify the argument when a reasonable default exists.  When you want to specify a value, you can.  We have one overload simply call the other in order to avoid repeating ourselves.  Despite trying to avoid repeating ourselves, we really still have duplicated a few lines and a handful of characters of code here.  Enter default arguments:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456047.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>What Really Happens</h2>
<p>This seems like a great little addition to the language.  It <em>feels</em> like the compiler is going to react to this by effectively writing the simple overload for me.  Unfortunately, including a default value does something else entirely.  Instead of &#8220;writing my overload for me&#8221;, the compiler <em>alters the call sites</em> that make use of this method, effectively copying-and-pasting a <code>null</code> whenever we call the method.</p>
<p>In simple scenarios, this distinction doesn&#8217;t matter.  The moment it does matter, though, you are going to be surprised.</p>
<h2>Interfaces Allow Contradictory Defaults</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;ve got some classes that perform an operation against an input int:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456058.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Ok, no surprises yet.  When we omitted the argument in the first call, the compiler copied and pasted a 1 into the call site.</p>
<p>As we start adding more and more such operations to the program, a developer finds a need to extract a common interface for all such one-argument operations.  This developer means well, but when he writes the interface definition, he doesn&#8217;t look at each and every implementing class&#8217;s defaults.  He figures 0 is a reasonable default for an integer, and defines it like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456065.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><em>Note that the default in the interface is different from the defaults on the concrete classes.</em></p>
<p>Running the same sample code produces the same output as before:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456075.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This makes sense.  We&#8217;re calling <code>Negate.Apply</code>, and <code>Negate.Apply</code>&#8217;s default comes into play just like before.  We might (incorrectly!) conclude that the concrete runtime type (<code>Negate</code>) is used to determine which default value &#8220;wins&#8221; the competition.</p>
<p>Later, a new developer joins the project.  He is unaware that the interface and concrete classes have conflicting defaults.  He&#8217;s read up on SOLID principles and naturally he wants to favor abstract types over concrete types.  He makes one seemingly-safe change to the code, changing only the declared type of the <code>operation</code> variable:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3456080.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The C# compiler finds our efforts to apply &#8220;nonbreaking changes&#8221; quaint but ultimately futile.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What in the <em>what!?</em></h2>
<p>The runtime type of <code>operation</code> is the same as in the previous execution, and that type oh-so-clearly defines its own default as 1.  However, <strong>the selection of which method will actually run is a separate decision from the selection of which default value gets copy/pasted to the call site.</strong>  Default value selection is based on the compile-time type of <code>operation</code> (<code>IUnaryOperation</code>), because the copy/paste <em>happens</em> at compile time.  The selection of which method needs to execute happens at runtime, upon inspecting the actual type of <code>operation</code> (<code>Negate</code>).</p>
<p>In order to use default values well, you have to constantly think about how they were implemented.  That&#8217;s enough to make you want to completely avoid this feature.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still willing to use default arguments, with one simple rule of thumb: <strong>pretend that you may only ever use a default value of 0, null, or false; <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/83fhsxwc(v=vs.80).aspx">the same defaults</a> we already expect for otherwise-uninitialized variables.</strong>  If we always use these predictable defaults, we can avoid verbose overload definitions while being confident that we won&#8217;t have our explicit defaults ignored at runtime.</p>
