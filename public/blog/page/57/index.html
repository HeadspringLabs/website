			How to Add a Method to ViewBag in ASP.NET MVC</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We are all familiar with the basic HomeController in the default ASP.NET MVC project.  We know we can pass values from the controller to the view.  Sometimes we are tempted to pass the controller itself to the view so that we can call methods on it.  The view should not have to depend on the controller.  This post provides a way to accomplish this.  For more on ASP.NET MVC, check out my book, <a href="http://bit.ly/aspnetmvc3inaction">ASP.NET MVC 3 in Action</a>.  You can also check out the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/headspring/mvc-boot-camp/" target="_blank">MVC Boot Camp</a> training we offer at <a href="http://www.headspring.com">Headspring</a>.  We start with the HomeController.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image2.png"><img style="border: 0px;" alt="image" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb2.png" width="530" height="403" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We know from just a little reading that the ViewBag property on HomeController is a dynamic object – using the new .Net 4 dynamic capabilities.  Merely setting the Message property on the object creates the property.  It is not completely obvious how to create a new method on the object, though.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>If I were to want to use a method in my Razor view like this&#8230;</p>
<div class="csharpcode"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image3.png"><img style="border: 0px;" alt="image" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb3.png" width="535" height="274" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>&#8230; then I would need to figure out how to get the GetCurrentTime() method onto the ViewBag.  The following is the solution to that problem.</p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>There are two technical capabilities of C# 4 that provide the ability to accomplish our new method.  The first is that I can create and set any new property on the dynamic object.  The second is actually a feature of .Net 2 – delegates.  I will create a method and then wrap it in a delegate and assign it as a property of ViewBag.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image4.png"><img style="border: 0px;" alt="image" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb4.png" width="538" height="344" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>.Net 3.5 brought us the Func&lt;&gt; and the lambda expressions.  These make delegates so much more concise to write and read.  I have now create a method, assigned it to a object and set it as a property on ViewBag.</p>
<p>The only thing left to do is to dereference the property and invoke it with ().</p>
<p>For those of you who have been programming for a while, you know that I technically haven’t create a method on the ViewBag object.  That is correct.  We have to think back to why I asked for the method in the first place.</p>
<h1>Why do we need methods?</h1>
<p>We need methods in order to retrieve values that are resolved at run time.  For instance, if I need to pass in some view-specific value to my ViewBag for evaluation, I need a method. If you were ever tempted to pass a reference to the controller to the view just to be able to execute a method on a value the controller owned, this is your ticket to accomplishing that.  Because the method/closure/delegate in the controller has full scope access to the controller memory space, the ViewBag now holds the gateway to the controller’s state that is necessary.</p>

			Developing ASP.NET MVC With Visual Web Developer Express 2010</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When the “Express” line of Visual Studio products was introduced with Visual Studio 2008, the Web Developer tool was a one-trick pony.  You could create a web site, and that was pretty much it.  No support for groupings of projects into solutions.  In other words, you couldn’t create libraries at the same time as the web site.</p>
<p>When ASP.NET came on the scene, this posed a problem.  MVC required web application projects, not the web site directory.  Visual Web Developer was enhanced a few times along with the way, and now it is a much more usable package.</p>
<h1>Capabilities of Visual Web Developer</h1>
<p>First, you can install Visual Web Developer for free using the Web Platform Installer.  In real terms, don’t try installing it by itself.  You will find yourself tracking down NuGet, SP1, MVC toolkit refresh, etc.  Just go to <a href="http://www.asp.net/vwd">this link to install</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image.png"><img style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb.png" alt="image" width="442" height="323" align="right" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After you install and run for the first time, go ahead and create your ASP.NET MVC 3 project.  I selected the “Internet Application” project because it wires up forms authentication for me and gives me a start controller and view.</p>
<p>You can see in this picture that I’m looking at the home controller’s index view that uses the new Razor syntax.</p>
<p>You can also see that the Solution Explorer supports class library projects.</p>
<p>Another new feature of VWD 2010 is that is supports “Extensions”.  This is an extensibility point.  The NuGet package is implemented as an extension.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image1.png"><img style="margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" width="341" height="237" align="left" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There are many other extensions that can be installed to enhance the capabilities of VWD 2010.  Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> is not one of these.  (By the way, if you haven’t yet installed ReSharper 6, you should do that now.  It provides fabulous support for ASP.NET MVC and Razor views).</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.headspring.com">Headspring</a>, we still use the full Visual Studio 2010 for custom application development because we really like the extra capabilities, but if you are looking to get started with MVC websites on .Net, go for VWD first.</p>

			Creating a Glimpse Plugin to Log SQL Generated by NHibernate</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Glimpse has generated a lot of buzz since it was <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/HanselminutesOn9/Hanselminutes-on-9-Glimpse-at-the-Mix11-Open-Source-Fest" target="_blank">unveiled</a> earlier this year during the “Open Source Fest” at the Mix 2011 conference. If you’re not already using it to debug your ASP.NET Web Forms or MVC application, you should be. Glimpse allows you to inspect several server-side diagnostic and request related information with a UI just like Firebug. Here’s some resources to get you started if you need an intro:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://getglimpse.com/" target="_blank">GetGlimpse.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NuGetPackageOfTheWeek5DebuggingASPNETMVCApplicationsWithGlimpse.aspx" target="_blank">NuGet Package of the Week – Glimpse</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several <a href="http://getglimpse.com/Help" target="_blank">built-in plugins</a> for Web Forms and MVC that will serve many needs, and you can even create your own. This tutorial will demonstrate how to create a plugin that will display the SQL generated by NHibernate.</p>
<h2>Glimpse Plugins</h2>
<p>Plugins are implemented by a simple class that implements the IGlimpsePlugin interface. There are a couple of great “hello world” example plugins on the Glimpse <a href="http://getglimpse.com/Help/CreatingPlugins" target="_blank">creating plugins page</a>. Besides setting the name and some optional start-up code, a plugin’s main job is just to return some set of data that will be rendered to the Glimpse UI. What that data is and how we get it is the real magic, so read on below.</p>
<p>The actual code for this NHibernate Glimpse plugin is fairly simple. We create a header column, add a row indicating the number of SQL statements that were executed and then add all the actual SQL to the plugin data. The SqlLogger class referenced here is just a static class that acts as a wrapper for the HttpContext.Items collection, which is where we’re logging the SQL itself. You can find a full gist including this class and all of the following code snippets, with comments, <a href="https://gist.github.com/1114503" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1114428.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Logging the SQL generated by NHibernate</h2>
<p>The easiest way to log the SQL generated by NHibernate so it can be pushed up to Glimpse is to create a custom Log4Net appender and configure it in the web.config. It’s as simple as creating a class that extends the AppenderSkeleton base class and implement the Append method, like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1114440.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Wiring up the web.config:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1114446.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>The hard part</h2>
<p>There is no hard part! We’re done! Drop this into an application that’s using NHibernate, enable Glimpse, click over to the new NHibernate tab, and wonder how you ever lived without this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GlimpseNhibernate.png"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GlimpseNhibernate_thumb.png" alt="NHibernate Glimpse Plugin" width="559" height="145" border="0" /></a></p>

			From Programmer to Manager</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I started my career as a programmer. I was fortunate enough to get into computing as the Internet revolution was a strong possibility in the early nineties. My career has largely followed the rise of the PC, the Internet, and now cloud computing. Being one of the first on my block with an email address and a web site (which we called &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page">home pages</a>&#8221; back then), I started web development very early.</p>
<h1>In the beginning</h1>
<p>I started my professional programming career as a programmer at the local school district. Some of my software is still running today, and one of their websites for teachers and high school counselors is still online and serving their needs. It&#8217;s written in ASP Classic, but it works well. My first applications used Internet Database Connector technology with ODBC data sources and HTX templates on IIS 2 running on Windows NT 4 servers. As far as I know, this was the birth of the &#8220;code nugget&#8221; in ASP.NET (&lt;% %&gt;). Microsoft <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms525756(v=vs.90).aspx">still supports this technology</a>.</p>
<p>As my career progressed and I <img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/072711_1557_FromProgram15.png" alt="" align="left" />became more senior as a programmer, I vowed that I would never enter management. After all, I enjoyed coding all day, and I saw some examples of bosses that didn&#8217;t understand the underlying complexities involved in software.</p>
<p>After a few years as a Senior Software Developer, I became interested in not only programming the software that was the solution but also in performing the analysis work to look at a situation and decide the overarching solution.</p>
<h1>The switch</h1>
<p>Later, I became interested in business, and now I am the Chief Operating Officer at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring, LP</a>. Headspring is a <img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/072711_1557_FromProgram25.jpg" alt="" align="right" />custom software company in Austin, TX. We help companies compete by helping them get greater value out of their existing custom software investments as well as creating new custom software assets for them. I can see on a daily basis the real operating dollars generated and saved by our software solutions we have deployed for our customers.</p>
<p>My view of the industry has changed quite a bit now that I am a manager. Because Headspring is a custom software company, I still program (everyone does), but I also do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow our people</li>
<li>Close out monthly financials</li>
<li>Perform financial and operation briefings for the company</li>
<li>Recruit new technical staff</li>
<li>Set compensations levels and promote staff</li>
<li>Manage facilities</li>
<li>Manage vendors</li>
<li>Help set company strategy</li>
</ul>
<h1>Professional development</h1>
<p>We have a learning culture here at Headspring. Everyone is given time for and expected to foster what we call Continuous Improvement. In fact, CI Time is one of the things we track on our time system. Because we are a professional services company, we bill by the hour; therefore, we track every hour.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/072711_1557_FromProgram35.gif" alt="" align="left" />In January of 2011, I began a new initiative in my own quest for continuous improvement. I started the MBA program at the <a href="http://www.jwmi.com/">Jack Welch Management Institute</a>. JWMI is a 2-year MBA program started and authored by the long-time CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. After reading Jack&#8217;s book, <em>Winning</em>, I knew that I could learn a lot from him, and I jumped at the opportunity to apply to be in his Masters of Business Administration program. I have already learned so much about business communication, leadership, strategy, and people management. As a manager, I am seeing that people management might be the most important topic covered in the program.</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s next?</h1>
<p>As a manager, my success depends completely on the work of others, not myself. The only way I succeed is if others succeed. That&#8217;s the big difference between hands-on work and management work. People decisions can make or break an outcome. I have learned a great deal since entering management five years ago. I also know that I have so much more to learn. I am grateful for a terrific staff. They constantly challenge me to find other great people they can work with, and I do that to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>The more I learn, the more I discover how much there is to learn.</p>

			Test-driven Development</a>

<p>TDD is an excellent safeguard against bugs. Why is test-driven development specifically vital in Agile development?</p>
<p>The hardest part of implementing a new feature is keeping all of the existing features working.</p>
<p>Software can be very complicated, and if you were trying to visualize it, although I don&#8217;t like to compare the software we build to a Rube Goldberg machine, you might be able to think of it in those terms, in that if you have a device which works in just such a way and then you add to it there is a good chance that it will no longer continue to work like it did.</p>
<p>What test-driven development allows you to do is to essentially lock into place the features that you&#8217;ve built that you know were working, so that in the future if anything you change would affect the functionality of those features you&#8217;ll get a report on that within an hour or two at the most. Then you can take corrective action without having to do exhaustive testing on the system, which, when a system becomes significant, can actually become almost impossible to do by humans.</p>
<p>I think anyone that&#8217;s been in software development, who has done a software project, either internally or with a partner, has probably experienced bugs and defects. Typically you&#8217;ll see those when you add a feature and a couple of things break that used to work. That happens a lot. It is a trapping of development.</p>
<p>Whether it is in<a href="http://www.headspring.com/resources/whitepapers/" target="_blank"> Agile development</a> methodology or whether it&#8217;s in something else it is critical to make sure the software quality is present as one works into the future in enhancing or adding to the system.</p>
<p>Typically, a lot of the systems that we see are pretty critical to running a client&#8217;s business or to executing projects. They are something that helps businesses, from a technology side, have an advantage over their competition or deliver their services faster or better or in a more streamlined manner. When you have a system like that, that is that critical, you can&#8217;t afford to have downtime. You can&#8217;t afford to add a feature and then have ten things that used to work break, and so test-driven development is important because it helps mitigate the risk and helps issues come to the surface much more quickly before they&#8217;ve reached production or affected customer service negatively.</p>
<p>Specifically with regards to Agile, test-driven development allows you to change the system which is the whole basis for Agile development in the first place. (Without going into the long explanation of Agile essentially it means that instead of waiting for a year to release the software you&#8217;ll wait a month with the expectation that you&#8217;ll change it again each month and release it again. Because you&#8217;re iterating on functionality development, you&#8217;re going to be changing existing functionality over and over again until you get to your ultimate goals.) Having a system that you can change quickly is critical to Agile development.</p>
<h2>The Gotcha Question (and its answer)</h2>
<p>Given the protections of TDD, why should stakeholders feel the need to manually test or demo code or to kick the tires at any level whatsoever?</p>
<p>One of the misperceptions about test-driven development is that it results in 100% defect-free software, and that&#8217;s actually not the case, because the software you write is only as good as the ways you think to test it. You might think of the same thing for perhaps a building in that a building&#8217;s strength is only as good as the weight against it, testing it, and if you don&#8217;t plan for a certain type of event, like an earthquake or a strong wind from a certain angle, then the building could potentially fail because the tests the building was put through did not account for the scenario. It is the same with software.</p>
<ul>
<li>The advantage of TDD is that when you do discover that defect, you can write a test to expose the defect, correct the defect, and never see it again.</li>
<li>The introduction of defects is actually not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is the introduction of defects over and over again as you maintain the software that can really kill the software&#8217;s budget and thus the effectiveness of an organization&#8217;s operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think there are certain things that tests can&#8217;t account for and it deals with the user interaction side of applications. It&#8217;s important for clients to test the system or use it just to make sure that it functions how they thought it would. Chances are really good that when a client conceives of a new piece of functionality, or a new idea, that they see it working in their head one way, but once they actually use it they realize they&#8217;ve learned new things that they didn&#8217;t know before and that they&#8217;ll want to implement some changes to that end. So, while the software can work exactly as it was designed to work, it might not be quite right for the business goals or the goals of the client, and so, just from that standpoint alone, making sure that the software is aligned with business goals and not with mean functional specifications is really important.</p>
<p>A test does not guarantee that there are zero defects. It just guarantees that there are no defects in the, in the ways the system is being tested. But, as the system matures and is tested and put through more and more rigorous paces, TDD essentially just cuts out a lot of wasted time that you might have otherwise accrued. Without getting too philosophical, because humans create software and humans are flawed, software, in a sense, will always be somewhat flawed, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn&#8217;t enforce strict engineering principles to try to improve the quality of what you create.</p>
