			Get to Know a Developer: Chris Missal</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/get-to-know-a-developer-chris-missal/2909_85bb896665_quarter" rel="attachment wp-att-3847"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3847" title="Chris Missal" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2909_85bb896665_quarter.png" alt="" width="160" height="160" /></a>Chris Missal, Senior Consultant at Headspring, is our newest addition to the team.  His background is mostly in web development using ASP.NET and MVC in the eCommerce industry.  At his last job, J&amp;P Cycles, he helped create a system for allowing third-party widgets to more clearly communicate with each other, therefore allowing his team to better understand and utilize information picked up from visitors of the site.  Yes, Chris is the guy that knows how to see everything that you see on the internet.  But for good, not for bad!</p>
<p>And his interests don’t stop there.  He’s currently learning Python, and along with coding, he likes disc golf and bowling.  He just moved to Austin from Iowa, and is really looking forward to getting into the social scene.  “The developer community is so lively here that I’ll be looking to get involved with groups that are passionate about making their communities so wonderful,” said Chris.</p>
<p>Here is how the rest of our talk went:</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I feel like somebody probably won’t write a book about something unless they could be considered an expert on the matter. I’ll answer this question by responding to the things that I think I could write a book about. A few things I could picture myself writing about: Unit testing, object-oriented programming and web page markup. Two things I’d love to add to that list that I’m working on is git and JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>I think it would be really to fun to work with the team at GitHub. I think I would have a good time working with people building things like cars that drive themselves, space shuttles, undersea experiments, you know, the usual.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I became interested in technology in grade school while playing video games. As internet shifted more mainstream, I learned that I could play games online. This led me to take an interest in computers and the internet. While I’m not as much of a gamer as I used to be, I’m still very interested in building things that require human interaction. My primary focus is web sites and web applications.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>My first programming language was QBASIC. It started with me tinkering around in the Gorillas game, and not too long later I was writing my own game with sprites and even mouse support! My “gaming career” was short lived and I soon started building simple web pages, learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>I really do like teaching and training people on all sorts of topics. While I might feel outside my comfort zone when it comes to topics that are new to me, the things that I’m really experienced in are quite fun to teach to people. My favorite part of teaching is when I’m asked a really good question. Not only does that help me realize that they’re getting it, but it allows me to adjust and make sure I cover it next time.</p>
<p><strong>Where do begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to libraries and frameworks I usually start with source code, and hopefully on GitHub. Since not everything is open source, I like to use tools like Decompilers to understand what is really going on within the project. Blog posts are also really great to reference. When it comes to methodology and management skills, I prefer hard copy books.</p>

			Becoming a Headspringer: Know Thy ReSharper</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Since I&#8217;m new to Headspring and we are hiring, I thought I would help give an edge to anyone applying and subscribing to our blog. There are many “features” (pun attempted) that make up a Headspringer and I’m hoping my fellow Headspring bloggers will help me verbalize them through the “Becoming a Headspringer” blog series. I will be starting this series with some quick tips on <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>. If you do not already have ReSharper or know what it is, immediately after reading this post is as good a time as any to try it out.</p>
<p>I was assigned my first development project a few weeks ago and was quickly told my hand reached for the mouse too often by Mr. Justin Pope. If you know me at all, you know that I enjoy shortcuts and dislike the mouse quite a bit. In fact, at my previous job, I removed all of my team members’ mice so they would be forced to learn to navigate with the keyboard for a day. So when  I was told I use the mouse too much, I knew I was going to love it at Headspring and thoroughly enjoy becoming a Headspringer. Shortly after a friendly insult, Mr. Justin Pope gave me a quick crash course in many of the common ReSharper shortcuts and I will share some of those shortcuts with you.</p>
<h2>Navigate to a File</h2>
<p>ctrl+n (to navigate to specific type) or ctrl+shift+n (to navigate to a specific file or folder)</p>
<h2>Highlight within File</h2>
<p>ctrl+w (continue pressing w until everything you want highlighted is highlighted)</p>
<h2>Safe Delete</h2>
<p>alt+del (tells you whether or not it’s safe to delete a method, property, class, etc)</p>
<h2>Go to Usages</h2>
<p>ctrl+alt+f7 (shows all usages of a particular method, property, class, etc)</p>
<h2>Parameter information</h2>
<p>ctrl+p (must be just inside parentheses)</p>
<h2>Create Constructor</h2>
<p>1. alt+insert (not just to insert constructor)</p>
<p>2. Select “Constructor” (if you already have fields defined, it will prompt if you want to initialize them)</p>
<h2>Introduce Variable</h2>
<p>1. Highlight what needs to become a variable</p>
<p>2. ctrl+alt+v</p>
<h2>Move Variable to Outer Scope</h2>
<p>1. Navigate near the variable name</p>
<p>2. alt+enter</p>
<p>3. Select “Move to outer scope”</p>
<h2>Create a New Class or File Based on Another</h2>
<p>1. ctrl+n (to navigate to a similar class) or ctrl+shift+n (to navigate to a similar file)</p>
<p>2. alt+shift+l (to navigate to the file in the Solution Explorer)</p>
<p>3. ctrl+c (to copy)</p>
<p>4. ctrl+v (to paste)</p>
<p>5. F2 (to rename)</p>
<p>6. Enter (to open)</p>
<p>7. Start modifying the file</p>
<p align="left">The shortcuts above are a small percentage of the shortcuts I found useful, but a good start to becoming a more productive developer. You may also notice that not all of these are specifically ReSharper shortcuts, some of them are Visual Studio or Windows shortcuts. Anyhow, you can <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/webhelp/Reference__Keyboard_Shortcuts.html">find a more extensive list of ReSharper shortcuts on the Jetbrains site</a>.</p>
<p align="left">As I mentioned above, Headspring is hiring. So if you are interested in being challenged, working with smart people, and being led by a great group of people, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/about-us/careers">apply</a>!</p>

			Creative Leap Year Ideas for the Office</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Because it’s a leap year, we get to take advantage of an extra day of work.  What are you going to do with all the extra time?! Here is a list of great ideas to make February 29th 2012 a day to remember:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Throw a party for your employees, or clients, or both</strong></p>
<p>Let the extra day stand out by throwing a leap year party at your office.  It doesn’t have to be wild; just a little happy hour will do fine.  Invite clients to join in, or keep it just for employees as a special “thank you” for their extra day of work.  Incorporate the party theme with fun ideas, like only playing music that was popular in a previous leap year, or giving prizes for people who create nostalgic costumes from popular fashion in other leap years, and playing games with quarters.</p>
<p><strong>2. Offer something for free</strong></p>
<p>Some companies are creating 25% off door buster promotions for leap year, but nothing beats free.  Host a seminar or a webinar on this extra day, or offer free books and whitepapers.  If you’re business is consulting, consider opening up half the day to help area non-profits and charities with free business advice.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Host an office contest</strong></p>
<p>Office contests are a great way to keep things interesting on an otherwise mundane day at work.  Hold an all day scavenger hunt or a contest that uses the number “4”, like four lines of poetry in four minutes and four-legged races.  If you can’t think of anything fun, split your staff up into teams of four and have them come up with cool contest ideas. Also, consider giving a special bonus or incentive for sales deals that are closed on February 29th.</p>
<p><strong>4. If you’re brave, give your employees the day off</strong></p>
<p>It may seem like a bold move, but what could you lose? Give them the option to take a half day or work from home – especially if the weather is nice.  Show the staff that the extra day is for their families and not work.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get involved with <a href="http://leapyearproject.org/">The Leapyear Project</a></strong></p>
<p>This is a simple startup that is encouraging people to take risks that could change the world this year.  Your business can choose a charitable project, promote it through this movement, and throw a party to celebrate the announcement.  You can also choose to become a corporate sponsor or partner, and assist other leap year projects through time/talent/donations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you do, big or small, don’t let the extra day go unnoticed.  Tell us how your company is using the extra day.</p>

			I Have Framework Commitment Issues</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once upon a time, a problem was identified. Shortly thereafter a solution was found. After all it wasn&#8217;t a tough problem and the solution was simple. A commercial framework was selected and the solution was implemented. Then it was re-implemented with an open source framework and then rolled back to the commercial framework. Both frameworks were evaluated and the findings revealed both frameworks had the features and functionality to solve the problem within the context of the solution. So what was the reason for indecisiveness?</p>
<p>To put it simply, it was a matter of commitment to a license.</p>
<p>Many folks in information technology have to evaluate software because there are typically at least two or more software packages that accomplish similar functions. Think about how many content management systems are available. Or how many virtualization solutions you can pick from. How about web servers? Text editors? Operating systems? The list goes on. In the business of software production we are often faced with similar choices. From selecting the programming languages to build tools, from source control to the integrated development environment (IDE), we are constantly tasked with evaluating things and selecting them. We make choices all the time.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, all the decisions would be as simple as picking the right tool for the job. That&#8217;s where it starts. We start picking the tool for the job. It&#8217;s not a hard thing to do. You eliminate the tools that don&#8217;t work at all. Then you exclude those that only solve part of the problem. You may find yourself with no remaining choices and this complicates things. But generally, you find a few tools that work well. It should be easy to just pick one. Right? A coin toss or a random drawing may seem to be all that is needed. But the fact is - in the real world it&#8217;s not that simple.</p>
<p>Frameworks and software have licenses and the licenses have implications&#8230; and that&#8217;s when you realize, &#8220;I have framework commitment issues&#8221;. How do you overcome these issues when selecting frameworks? It&#8217;s not always easy, but by asking a few questions the selection can become more apparent.</p>
<p><strong>How is the framework supported?</strong></p>
<p>When things go wrong and you need help, who will be there to help fix the problem? Will you have to fix it yourself?</p>
<p>Most open source software support is provided by the community. The community includes you. So aside from yourself, no one is under any obligation to help you. This means you should have the ability and resources to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Commercially licensed frameworks on the other hand usually offer some type of incident support.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it falls on you to make sure your solution works and meets expectations. Neither types of licenses free you from this.</p>
<p><strong>Is the framework proven?</strong></p>
<p>Who is using it and what do they have riding on it? Do some homework and ask around. There are many great commercial and open source frameworks.</p>
<p>If you have a lot riding on the framework you are about to select, you may want to conservatively go with a framework that is tried and true. It&#8217;s a safe bet until you use it in a way that has never been used before, but those situations are rare.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there won&#8217;t be a tried and true framework available. You should still ask around. It is rare to find yourself in a position where you are attempting something completely new that is not even remotely similar to another problem.</p>
<p>While your problem and solution may be unique, it does not imply that there no other problems or solutions that share similar traits.</p>
<p><strong>What resources are available to help you use the framework?</strong></p>
<p>Is there a book? A user group? A conference? Does anyone offer a training course or certification program? How good is the online documentation? Don&#8217;t forget to look for a bundled help file.</p>
<p><strong>What does the framework cost? The total cost?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Commercial software licenses are not free. Some get really expensive. But don&#8217;t let this deter you from purchasing it.</p>
<p>Open source software is free. Sort of. Think about what it may cost to support it in the event you can&#8217;t find any community help.</p>
<p>For either type of license, you are likely to incur cost related to learning the framework. Whether it is a developer&#8217;s time while they research it on the Internet or an intense multi-day certification course, expect to incur some direct and/or indirect cost.</p>
<p>Risk is inevitable. You can minimize this risk by using tried and true frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Should I build my own?</strong></p>
<p>This is the most expensive and riskiest option. Let me state that one more time for good measure&#8230;</p>
<p>This is the most expensive and riskiest option. Sure you won&#8217;t have to worry about a license fee. You can also be certain you will be the one to support it (even if you open source it). Books, training, events, certifications, and similar resources won&#8217;t exist unless you make them (or you open source it and even then it’s not guaranteed).</p>
<p>Avoid rolling your own.</p>
<p><strong>How do I make the commitment?</strong></p>
<p>Pick a framework. As a rule of thumb pick a framework that meets your needs the best (even if it has a significant commercial license fee). If you have few good ones to choose from, consider the questions discussed. If you still can&#8217;t decide&#8230; flip a coin.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Deran Schilling</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Deran Schilling, Senior Consultant at Headspring,  is new to the team, and we have warmly welcomed him in as an additional web technology and design enthusiast.  After working in education for several years at LSU Alexandria, and Clear Creek ISD, Deran has gracefully transitioned to the corporate world and the Austin tech community.  So far, he has lead a team of Headspringers to participate in this year’s <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/headspring-shows-some-love-at-knowbilitys-austin-air">Knowbility Austin AIR</a>, and has plans for more events and competitions this year.  Here is some of our conversation:</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>In high school, I planned to be a band director, but ended up in a programming class my senior year.  From that point on, I was going to be a developer.  Lucky for me the college I chose has a great music program and CIS program.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Yes I do.  In my previous jobs, I would always offer up different training sessions from MVC to jQuery to SQL to CSS to whatever they asked to learn about.  I firmly believe that you don’t fully understand something until you can teach it.  Occasionally, I call some of my developer friends to tell them about something new I learned.  In the conversation, I can determine if I really understand it.  If they ask a lot of questions that I can’t answer, I know I need to learn more.  Hopefully they don’t read this post and know they’re my guinea pigs.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on what I’m learning because I have different approaches for various things, but if we’re talking about a new technology then I gauge my co-workers and some reviews on whether or not it’s even worth learning.  If it is, I’ll jump into Google and find some blog posts.  If I can’t find any blog posts, I’ll buy the book.   If there is no book, I’ll figure it out myself and then blog about it.  This way, there will be a post that other people and myself can reference.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent?”</strong></p>
<p>I gauge it based on how much value was brought to the company or to a relationship.  I value the time in the break room or at our lunches because carefully built relationships are important to a healthy team.  One of the main reasons I wanted to come to Headspring is because they seem very people-oriented.  We all work out of the Headspring office, which I think makes for a stronger team, and we are involved in the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
