			Polaroid Mutation</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week, we saw how <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/clojures-world-view">Clojure&#8217;s approach to syntax</a> can influence the way we think while using other languages.  Today, we&#8217;ll see how Clojure&#8217;s strong opinions about state change can similarly affect the way we think in our language of choice.</p>
<p>Some languages embrace mutation (the changing of variables&#8217; values at runtime).  Python and Ruby classes have publicly-settable <em>everything</em> and although this can get you into trouble it can also lead to some pretty slick tools like Ruby on Rails.  Clojure, on the other hand, fears mutation.</p>
<h2>.NET Strings are Immutable</h2>
<p>.NET&#8217;s <code>System.String</code> is a good example of Clojure&#8217;s approach to collections.  Once you have a string instance, you cannot change its content.  If you want to change the string you are currently referencing, you have to instead create a whole new string (often based on the original), and then point your reference variable at the new one.</p>
<p>Although potentially-wasteful with memory, this approach has saved us from a lot of potential complexity.  When I pass a string around, I know it&#8217;s not going to be altered by some rogue library call.  I can expose a string across threads without fear that it will be in mid-change when I try to look at it.</p>
<p>This immutability can be problematic for large strings that are being frequently &#8216;changed&#8217;, but in practice most of the change we deal with is with small strings where the performance hit is trivial.  In those cases where it <em>really</em> matters, we can use something like <code>StringBuilder</code> to avoid being wasteful with memory and time.</p>
<h2>.NET Lists Mutate</h2>
<p>.NET&#8217;s <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, on the other hand, is mutable.  We can think of strings as an immutable collection of <code>char</code> values.  A <code>List&lt;char&gt;</code>, on the other hand, can be <strong>changed</strong> rather than simply <strong>replaced</strong>.  You can add, remove, and alter each item in the collection, <em>and anyone looking at the object will see those changes right away, whether they like it or not</em>.</p>
<h2>Clojure Collections are Immutable</h2>
<p>The built-in data structures in Clojure are immutable.  The two main types here are lists (corresponding with .NET <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>), and maps (corresponding with <code>Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>In Clojure, when you have a list containing 1000 elements and you wish to append item number 1001, you don&#8217;t change the contents of the original list.  Rather, you get a whole new list containing 1001 elements.  This is exactly what we would do with a .NET string to append a single char.</p>
<p>For maps, adding a new key/value pair likewise starts by copying the original collection and including the new pair.  Anyone who is still holding a reference to the original sees the original contents unaffected.</p>
<p>That may seem wasteful, since the use cases for lists are far more varied than for strings.  Aren&#8217;t we going to feel the pain of this waste too easily in practice for it to be a good idea?</p>
<p>Thankfully, Clojure collections are clever.  Behind the scenes, <a href="http://blog.higher-order.net/2009/02/01/understanding-clojures-persistentvector-implementation">lists and a maps are really trees</a>.  The items are stored in the leaves, and whenever we need to create a &#8220;whole new collection&#8221;, the new collection will share as much of the original tree as it can sneakily get away with.  The new collection is safe to share data with the original tree because, after all, nobody is <em>allowed</em> to change it.</p>
<p>Despite storing items in a tree, Clojure lists can still provide the <em>near</em> constant-time lookups we expect from lists.  These trees are exceptionally <em>wide</em>, but not very <em>deep</em>.  Even a fully-populated tree, with more items in it than you&#8217;d ever care to work with, is only about 6 levels deep.  <em>Slower than a .NET array lookup, for sure, but still O(1)</em>.  Well, O(1-<em>ish</em>).</p>
<h2>Course-Grained Mutation</h2>
<p>Clojure does allow some mutation.  It would be difficult to use a language if it had <em>no</em> notion of assignment statements.  A small number of special reference types are available.  These are objects which can point at some other object, and this pointer can be requested to change to point to some new object.  These types are each opinionated about how this re-pointing can act with respect to threads, but the basic idea is that they allow for course-grained mutation.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say I have one of these reference objects currently pointing at a map containing many name/value pairs, and that I&#8217;m using <a href="http://clojure.org/refs">a reference object that ensures transactional re-pointing in the presence of multiple threads</a>.  If I have to perform a significant change to the collection, <strong>I&#8217;d like to be able to take my time to calculate the new version of the collection, without having to lock the original</strong>, so the other threads can keep on trucking along.  Once I&#8217;ve calculated my new collection, sharing a subtree behind the scenes with the original, I&#8217;ll ask my reference object to re-point to the new collection as an atomic operation.  Now, all the other threads will see the new state.</p>
<p><em>C# represents state change by physically altering an object in-place.  Clojure represents state change by tracking a series of object snapshots.</em>  <strong>The river isn&#8217;t flowing by you in front of your eyes.  Instead, you have a stack of river-photos representing the key moments of its flow.</strong></p>
<h2>Minimizing Mutation in Your Language of Choice</h2>
<p>Clojure&#8217;s weird, and weird is good.</p>
<p>Some of the worst spaghetti code I&#8217;ve ever dealt with was hard to untangle <strong>precisely</strong> because of the fine-grained state change involved.  The first thing I do when faced with a tricky mess like this is to start identifying those parts of the code that are already lacking mutation, pulling them out into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a>.  Next, I look for ways to rephrase the existing mutation-heavy bits with equivalent pure alternatives.  <strong>Often, the percent of your codebase that actually needs to deal with mutating state is remarkably small.</strong></p>

			Office Plants and Employee Productivity</a>

		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/office-plants-and-employee-productivity/istock_000012541472small" rel="attachment wp-att-2645"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2645" title="iStock_000012541472Small" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iStock_000012541472Small-300x236.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a>Do you have live potted plants in your office? Or a view out the window that is more scenic than an asphalt parking lot? If not, you could be leaving creativity behind.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/59-Seconds-Little-Change-Borzoi/dp/0307273407">59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot</a>&#8221; by Psychologist and author Richard Wiseman. The book contains a firehose of fascinating research studies and conclusions aimed to help change your life in under a minute. One passage goes on to detail how much of an impact greenery can have on your workplace productivity.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;An eight-month study of creativity in the workplace conducted by Robert Ulrich at Texas A&amp;M University showed that adding flowers and plants to an office resulted in a 15 percent increase in ideas from male employees and more flexible solutions to problems from their female counterparts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Wiseman (what a name, huh?) goes on to discuss several other studies including one done by Andrew Elliot at the University of Rochester that compared creativity levels of people in rooms of different color, where green walls were a clear winner over red. If you don&#8217;t want to read the book, a quick Google search will yield a plentiful amount of information on the benefits of plants and the color green (like this <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2002499/Stressed-work-Put-pot-plants-desk.html">one</a>).</p>
<p>So now that you&#8217;re convinced, why does greenery  have such an effect? According to Wiseman, evolutionary psychologiests suggest that centuries ago when humans lived amid healthy trees and plants it resulted in a sense of comfort and calm because it meant food was nearby. And pleasant feelings make people more helpful, happy and creative. Hard to argue that.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, several studies agree: a plant in your office would do you some good. Do you have plants in your office? Why or why not?</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Anne Epstein</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>“There once was a girl named Anne,<a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/get-to-know-a-developer-anne-epstein/img_5587" rel="attachment wp-att-2604"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2604" title="IMG_5587" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_5587-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Who didn’t want to do any planning.</p>
<p>She wrote teh codes,</p>
<p>And even this ode,</p>
<p>But found that her rhymes were uncanny.”</p>
<p>Officially, she is the NHibernate master of Headspring.  However, Anne Epstein has been in web development since 1998.  She has followed its many changes with a close eye ever since. She has achieved what now can be labeled as “adaptive expertise” in understanding how technology changes - and how to change with it.</p>
<p>For all this and more, Anne has proven herself as an indispensable team member at Headspring through careful risk mitigation, attention to detail, and valuable communication skills.</p>
<p>“She is great at looking around dark corners and cracks for danger; we are able to better anticipate what our clients need because of her,” says Glenn Burnside, Director of Software Development.  For example, with a recent client, she was noted for being proactive about finding a solution which allowed constant monitoring of a software system we were hosting.  This proactive system prevented server errors, even outside of business hours.  Anne will tell you that this ability to calculate risk stems from her childhood fear of… everything.  “I couldn’t even fantasize about what I wanted to be as a kid! I was constantly worried about the dangers of the various professions I was drawn to, like firefighting, or teaching, or whatever.”</p>
<p>As young Anne matured through her fears and experiences, she developed an incredible skill for microscopic attention to detail.  This skill is what her teammates enjoy most about working alongside her.  They enjoy not having to explain every premise in order to discuss a project.  “She just gets it! I know that if I hand something over, she’ll figure it out,” says Principal Consultant Mahendra Mavini.  This fascination with detail is evident in her personal life, as well.  She is drawn to deeply technical challenges and hobbies, such as learning new programming languages (she is currently learning Python), competitive ballroom dancing, and anything involving the use of power tools.  She is even experimenting with a personal project that involves building her own web browser. This is quite the transition from her indecisive childhood!</p>
<p>Although what Anne values most is being truly helpful to those around her.  “I really enjoy helping people accomplish things at Headspring.  It’s not just about money here.  There is integrity in what we do.” Particularly, Anne values honest and valuable communication.  “Developers often want to one-up their clients, instead of just helping them.”  Instead, Anne strives to present her thoughts with clarity and honesty.  She credits her early career in the trenches of tech support for the ability to connect problems to a solution that anyone can understand.  Now that she is in consulting, the same genuine desire to communicate effectively allows her to be helpful with her own clients. Once, she suggested an alternate, open-source approach to a project that could be purchased, instead of having to be custom built.  She was later commended for not taking advantage of the client’s limited knowledge on the subject by promoting her own.  They were able to gain a maintainable solution, for less effort and money.</p>
<p>So if you have any questions about NHibernate, power tools, building a web browser, limerick writing, or ballroom dancing, contact Anne Epstein. It will certainly be more enjoyable than searching Google.  Also, check out her <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/anne_epstein/default.aspx">blog</a>, or tweet @ajepst.</p>

			Clojure&#8217;s World View</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The programming language you use has a very large impact on the way you think about problems. Despite superficial similaries, each language comes with its own set of opinions about what is Important, what is Clean, what is Right, and what is Dangerous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to take a look at the opinions of languages outside of your comfort zone, in case any of those tools can be incorporated into your toolbelt. My language of choice is C#, partly because it has similarly been influenced by a wide range of other languages. You <em>can</em> write Java in C#, but you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to.</p>
<p><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>&#8217;s view of the world is dramatically different from C# and Java, even though it runs on the JVM and can interop with Java libraries. There are two main areas where Clojure can be contrasted with C#: its syntax and its approach to state changes.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll see how Clojure&#8217;s approach to syntax can help us achieve brevity in C#. Next week, we&#8217;ll see how Clojure&#8217;s opinions can shape the way we think about state change.</p>
<h4><strong>Clojure Syntax</strong></h4>
<p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, which means the first thing you&#8217;ll notice (is all the (nested (parentheses))). The look and feel of Lisp dialects can be initially confusing to newcomers. Instead of saying <em>1 + 2 + 3</em>, we say <em>(+ 1 2 3)</em>. The name of an operation comes before its arguments, never between them. This inside-out syntax has an interesting effect: <strong>everything looks the same</strong>. Every construct in the language, from simple expressions, to conditional logic, to function and type definitions <code>(looks like this)</code>.</p>
<p>The fact that everything looks the same as everything else is a double-edged sword. I <em>like</em> that different constructs in C# <em>look</em> different. I find it helps me &#8220;chunk&#8221; up the screen as I read through something unfamiliar.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the extreme simplicity of Clojure syntax gives us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a>, meaning that every bit of Clojure code is also a description of a data structure, namely a list of lists. <em>(* 3 (+ 2 1))</em> is both an arithmetic expression to be evaluated <strong>and</strong> a list containing three items: the symbol <strong>*</strong>, the number <strong>3</strong>, and another list containing 3 more items.</p>
<p>Because all Clojure code is <em>also</em> a literal for a Clojure list, code generation becomes orders of magnitude simpler with Clojure than with C#. In fact, code generation is so common in Lisp dialects that it gets special treatment. A <strong>macro</strong> is a function whose job it is to take in code as its input and produce new code as its output. Even most of the seamingly-built-in keywords are in fact implemented as code-twiddling functions called early in the execution process.</p>
<h4><strong>Hypothetical C# Macros</strong></h4>
<p>Imagine we had a version of C# that didn&#8217;t have <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384054.aspx">auto properties</a>, but did have macros. With macros, we could effectively add a new keyword to the language, implementing it in a library, to give us the same shorthand:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1484258.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Our hypothetical macro function <strong>public macro Code prop(Code c) { &#8230; }</strong> would receive as its input a description of the code between &#8216;prop&#8217; and the semicolon, returning a description of the more elaborate property code. The compiler could call that function early on, generating the code we would have otherwise written:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1484255.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This hypothetical C# wouldn&#8217;t need <strong>using() { &#8230; }</strong> blocks, or even <strong>foreach</strong> loops, because those keywords could be implemented in a library in terms of other existing constructs. Most language features that we think of as &#8216;syntax sugar&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t have to be thought of by the language designers in advance. With Clojure, developers invent their own new syntax sugar as a part of their daily thought process.</p>
<h4><strong>Back to Reality</strong></h4>
<p>A future version of C#, codenamed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/roslyn">Roslyn</a>, will be exposing some of the compiler&#8217;s inner guts to us as a library. As with Clojure, we&#8217;ll be able to treat C# code as both a set of instructions and as a data structure. I <strong>seriously doubt</strong> this means that C# will gain macros, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we do end up seeing some powerful tools aimed at the same target as macros.</p>
<p>The closest thing to macros that we have today in C# is lambda expressions and their corresponding expression trees. HTML helpers in MVC, for instance, leverage the code-twiddling power of lambda expressions in order to prevent us from reaching for our copy/paste shortcuts, saving us from having to maintain monotonously-verbose view files. Once you hand developers a powerful code-traversal tool like this, you empower them to <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/opening-the-black-box">invent powerful shorthand of their own</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When you find yourself writing suspiciously-similar code in C# ask yourself, &#8220;What would Clojure do?&#8221;</strong></p>

			3 Redesigns I Love</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Several web redesigns have been coming out recently, so I put together a quick recap of the ones I am most excited about.</p>
<p>1.YouTube</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s redesign focuses mainly around making their channels more attractive to users.  The homepage now features a bar on the left with a list of subscribed and suggested channels, and a feed in the center.  Other featured videos are in a bar on the right, versus front and center on the previous design.</p>
<p>Another great benefit is the long overdue integration with Google accounts and social media.  It&#8217;s no longer necessary for new users to create an account if they have Gmail.  Visitors already logged into their Google account, are automatically logged in when they visit the homepage.  Who needs to remember another log in or password?  Also, Google+ and Facebook get prime spots in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>This video explains all the new features in under two minutes:</p>
<p>http://youtu.be/W-ajXnrpkio</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.  Twitter</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s most notable new features are the &#8220;me&#8221; and &#8220;discover&#8221; tabs.  Overall, a more comprehensive experience can be expected.</p>
<p>The &#8220;me&#8221; tab allows a user to introduce themselves to their profile visitors, allowing users to identify themselves past who they are following and where they are from.  This feature also allows followers to Tweet directly to you based on the provided information.  Direct messaging has also been redirected to this tab. The new &#8220;discover&#8221; tab will steam hashtagged and trending topics based on your interests, shared content, and location.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/3-redesigns-i-love/section_me_1_web_en" rel="attachment wp-att-2527"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2527" title="section_me_1_web_en" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/section_me_1_web_en.png" alt="" width="520" height="457" /></a></p>
<p>3. ASP.NET</p>
<p>Finally, after much adieu, ASP.NET has chosen to focus on providing more tutorials, and has made them easier to find.  The site has also undergone a major clutter-cleaning, making it more navigable in general.  Content is now organized based on relevancy. Also, the onboarding experience has been greatly improved.  The homepage definitely feels more inviting than before.  Lastly, the stream in the middle spotlights visitors with useful information about what&#8217;s going on in the community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/3-redesigns-i-love/image_3" rel="attachment wp-att-2535"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2535" title="image_3" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image_3.png" alt="" width="450" height="389" /></a></p>
