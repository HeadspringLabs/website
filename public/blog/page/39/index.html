			Get to Know a Developer: Nolan Egly</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3646" title="nolan egly" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/nolan-egly-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" />This week I was pleased to sit down and chat with Nolan Egly, our newest Senior Consultant at Headspring.  Nolan has been working as a software developer in Austin for years.  He was hired here at Headspring after being placed on our famous internal spreadsheet that lists our employees’ “dream” coworkers.  That is, if you could work with anyone, who would it be? Apparently it’s Nolan! </p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I’m an expert debugger, thanks in large part to being patient and ruthlessly methodical and organized while troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I got a TI 99-4A computer when I was a kid, and got hooked on programming simple games in BASIC.  There was just a sense of magic in getting the computer to do my bidding, once you can figure out how to instruct it.  As I got older I could see how computer programs make people’s lives better in so many different ways, and who can walk away from doing something you find fun that makes life better?</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy helping others, and teaching is really just a specialized form of helping by expanding someone’s knowledge of how things work.  The biggest reward is seeing that “aha” moment in others when it all comes together, it’s just like seeing a set of instructions you’ve put together do something useful on a computer.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I usually try a blend of hands on practice and academic study of the fundamentals, whether it’s a new programming language or a new craft like cake baking. Hands on practice and study is important – we learn from failures, and practice makes concepts real to us.  Rote memorization doesn’t stick if you don’t exercise what you’re learning.  Hands on practice also needs to be supplemented with a sound understanding of the theoretical underpinnings, or else you won’t completely understand the “whys” of what you’re doing, or be able to see new ways to accomplish things.</p>
<p><strong>When is the best time to test?</strong></p>
<p>When you are building some sort of high risk functionality. Something is high risk if the consequences of failure are high – security rules, for example. Something is also high risk if the chance of introducing a defect later is high. A few examples of this would be complex business rules, long multistep calculations, or conditional logic. I’m sure there is a lot more testing in, say, the aerospace industry, than in others. It all depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nolan went on to explain to me that he is the kind of person that is incredibly meticulous.  He posed the question, “Would you allow a computer you programmed to operate on you? I might; I don’t know. I just know that I am the kind of person that is going to be really diligent and meticulous about the details, just in case.”</p>

			Branching: Subversion vs Git</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At a previous job, I worked for a company that used Subversion for all of its projects.  This was a welcome change coming from a TFS and Visual Source Safe background.</p>
<p>We did relatively little work with branches.  For the most part, a branch was created only to represent the state we wanted to deploy to production.  In other words, everybody worked against trunk, and when we were happy with what we had we would create a branch with the version number as its name, and we would deploy from there.  If a hotfix was needed, at least we didn&#8217;t have to worry about deploying it along with incomplete features under development; we&#8217;d base the hotfix on the version branch and deploy that.</p>
<p>On one occasion, someone needed to make a fairly drastic change to the system.  It was a little risky, and would have interfered with the rest of the team if it was performed against trunk, so they made a feature branch for it.  About a month later, I was tasked with merging that back into trunk.</p>
<p><strong>This was, shall we say, an Interesting Merge.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout development of the branch, work being performed in the trunk had <em>not</em> been periodically merged into the branch, meaning that there were many, many conflicts without an obvious resolution.  Ultimately things worked out, but it didn&#8217;t seem like a great way to do things.  With my lack of exposure to alternatives, I didn&#8217;t really see the great benefit of frequent branching.</p>
<h2>Sane Branching</h2>
<p><strong>The whole concept of branching was intimidating to me because the <em>way</em> we did it caused more pain than it alleviated.</strong></p>
<p>Things have gotten better since then.  I&#8217;ve been able to experience a sane feature branching strategy with Subversion over the past year, and the pain was far outweighed by the benefits.  Throughout development of a feature branch, you periodically merge from the parent branch so that the effort of merging takes place <em>away</em> from the main line and in small doses.  When it&#8217;s time to merge the feature branch back to the parent, there&#8217;s very little risk involved because you already know that your changes work in concert with your coworkers&#8217; changes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a little frustrating with Subversion, though.  Branching and switching between branches are big and slow operations because they&#8217;re dealing with point-in-time copies of Big Honking Folders.  It&#8217;s almost a <em>coincidence</em> that Subversion is aware of the history involved.</p>
<h2>Saner Branching</h2>
<p>Git has <em>again</em> changed my mind about branching.  <strong>With Subversion, a branch is a whole new commit containing a point-in-time copy of your code.  With git, a branch is a named pointer to a commit you&#8217;ve already made.</strong>  You get a little less noise in your history because you don&#8217;t have to wade through phony commits: some Subversion commits represent real work performed, and some just represent the act of branching, which doesn&#8217;t really <em>tell</em> me something.</p>
<p>Creating a branch in git is extremely fast.  It doesn&#8217;t take long to write a commit ID to a local file, and that&#8217;s all there is to it.  Git lets all of your branches use the same workspace, and switching from one branch to another is also fast.  I find myself creating branches way more often than before.  It&#8217;s so fast and so simple compared to Subversion that speed/complexity no longer have to come into play when deciding whether or not to create one.  <strong>I&#8217;m about to start working on a new train of thought, so I branch.</strong></p>

			Headspring Shows Some Love at Knowbility&#8217;s Austin AIR</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just in time for Valentine’s Day, three Headspring consultants competed in the annual Austin Accessibility Internet Rally (Austin AIR) hosted by <a href="http://www.knowbility.org/">Knowbility.org</a>.  Knowbility&#8217;s website explains the goal of the rally is &#8220;to teach participating web developers and designers about the tools and techniques necessary to make the web accessible to everyone – including people with disabilities.&#8221;  In addition, participating nonprofits benefit by receiving professional help to build a new or replace an existing site.  Judging for the competition lasts a couple weeks, and the winner is announced at an awards ceremony in March.</p>
<p>Headspring-ers Anne Epstein, Mahendra Mavani and Deran Schilling showed up bright and early Saturday morning  to form their team, calling themselves the Headspring Hurwitzes (a tribute to our reigning Chief Architect, Kevin Hurwitz). They were assigned to Texas TERA with a mission to breathe life into their stale, outdated website.</p>
<p>Now this is a fine looking group:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Headspring-Hurwitzes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Headspring-Hurwitzes_thumb.jpg" alt="Headspring Hurwitzes" width="380" height="384" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/headspring-shows-some-love-at-knowbilitys-austin-air/headspring-hurwitzes-and-texas-tera" rel="attachment wp-att-3594"><img class="size-full wp-image-3594 aligncenter" title="Headspring Hurwitzes and Texas TERA" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Headspring-Hurwitzes-and-Texas-TERA.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="377" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team had a lot of fun and told me how happy they were about having the opportunity to participate.  “It was really a privilege to help out such an important and genuinely interesting and cool organization.  It turned out to be a lot of fun too,” said Anne Epstein.</p>
<p>Deran Schilling, who participated and and won last year’s Houston AIR event told me, “I think the best part was meeting the people that make Texas TERA successful.  They’re an amazing group of people and I was happy that we could help out.  That sounds so canned…but it’s true!”</p>
<p>Mahendra Mavani commented, &#8220;First or last, who cares about the winner now? We already won when we showed the happy faces of Texas TERA, who can now use their site on laptops, tablets, and smart phones.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Texas TERA representatives were also happy to be a part of the fun, and thanked their team for providing them with a dramatically improved site. They mentioned the biggest benefit is that now content can easily be edited by anyone on the board or staff, using any device, anywhere.</p>
<p align="left">Here’s a <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> look at what the Headspring Hurwitzes accomplished in an 8 hour window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Texas-TERA-website2.png"><img class="aligncenter" style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Texas-TERA-website_thumb2.png" alt="Texas TERA website" width="487" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>We’ll keep everyone posted as we find out more information, upcoming Austin AIR announcements and awards.  Stay tuned!</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Brandon Barry</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_5596_2.jpg"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_5596_2_thumb.jpg" alt="IMG_5596_2" width="164" height="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>From what our coworkers say, Senior Consultant Brandon Barry can go head to head with Jimmy Bogard about the internals of the .NET framework.  Recently, he wrote a library for .NET that allows for dynamic querying SQL databases using LINQ syntax, but with no configuration. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/maydaytx/DynamicLinq">Github</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, he is incredibly knowledgeable Headspring developer, and is known for his affinity for clean, elegant code.  In fact, he prefers refactoring rather than having to work around bad code.  He is also great proponent for balancing the benefit of tests without sacrificing quality.  Here’s what else I learned today:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I’m an expert in .NET.  I’m very strong with all things technical and I usually volunteer for the difficult problems.  I’m also creative (probably because I’m left-handed), which is why software development is my passion.  I’m also an expert rock bassist.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development? What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>When I was in 10th grade, I taught myself to program my TI-86 graphing calculator during math class.  I wrote programs to solve test questions so that I could just enter the inputs, and the program would show all the steps and the answer.   I also wrote a couple of simple text-based games that I let my classmates play.  Once I realized that I liked creating the game more than playing it, I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>So what came next?</strong></p>
<p>When it was time for college I knew I wanted to major in Computer Science.  However, I  couldn’t get into the program right away because of my grades, so I started in Mechanical Engineering.  I’ve always thought that was weird. Isn’t engineering supposed to be harder?  Anyway I transferred as soon as I could into the Computer Science department.  We learned a few languages and a lot of theory, but not a lot about best practices in development.  I acquired my “skill” for development at my first job out of college in Temple at McLane Advanced Technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I take the path of least resistance.  Sometime I follow an example.  I taught myself how to play chords on the guitar by watching my dad and brother play one day.  After they left the room, I was playing along to my first Nirvana song (<em>In Bloom</em>) in no time.  Other times I read a manual.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I gauge time well spent by how much enjoyment I get.  If you don’t enjoy what you are doing and have a passion for it, it’s really just a waste of time.</p>

			Am I Not Dead? Commit.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I mentioned last week, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/hey-tfs-git-out-of-my-way">started using git</a> recently, specifically a git-to-tfs bridge so that I can avoid as much contact with TFS as humanly possible.</p>
<p>Most of my recent experience has been with subversion, so I have been <em>unlearning</em> that as much as I have been <em>learning</em> git.  The most apparent difference right away is what it really means to make a &quot;commit&quot;.</p>
<p>With subversion, even when working in a feature branch, my commits would be immediately shared with my coworkers.  I was basically handing a diff to my coworkers every time I checked something in.   Since anything I committed would be immediately shared, I had an extra concern at commit-time: &#8220;If I commit right now, and someone else gets latest, will I mess things up for them?&#8221;.  Despite wanting to commit as often as possible, I could only allow myself to commit when I had completed <em>the smallest chunk of work that could be shipped if I got hit by a bus</em>.  This seemed like the most reasonable rule of thumb to follow, but even these commits could end up fairly large.</p>
<p>Subversion is like a video game with sparse save points.  You play for a while, maybe even an hour or two, before reaching a point where you&#8217;re even <em>allowed</em> to save your progress.  You might even get a little lost along the way, and you can&#8217;t just jump back to the last save point without wasting all that time.</p>
<p>Working with git has felt a lot more like playing the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)">Half-Life</a>.  Maybe it was really difficult, or maybe I was just terrible at it, but I found myself being squashed or blown up every other minute.  Thankfully, instead of having to make your way to a special save point, you could just save your progress at any moment or jump back to any previous save.  <strong>Have I moved 10 feet?  Am I not dead?  Save.</strong></p>
<p>Now that I can work with a local feature branch, I can think differently about what a commit actually <em>is</em>.  If I commit far more often than I did with subversion, I harm nobody; it&#8217;s all just local anyway.  When I ultimately push up to TFS, it&#8217;ll batch up all my local commits into a single set of changes representing the before/after comparison of all of my work.  Any missteps along the way won&#8217;t show up to my coworkers, yet while <em>doing</em> the work I could always look back to retrace my own train of thought.  <strong>Have I made any forward progress, shippable or not?  Am I not dead? Commit.</strong></p>
