<p><strong><em></em></strong>Austin, TX – June 07, 2012, Austin-based Headspring, a custom application development and consulting firm, today announced it has been recognized as one of the Austin Business Journal’s “Best Places to Work” in Central Texas.  Headspring ranked number four in the Small Companies category of the 2012 list.</p>
<p>Headspring was chosen as one of the top-five Best Places to Work in Central Texas after a series of voluntary employee surveys which examined climate, team atmosphere, benefits and employee engagement. <img title="More..." src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>“It is such an honor to be named one of the 2012 Best Places to Work in Austin,” says CEO/Founder Dustin Wells. “Austin is a rapidly growing city with an expansive job market; job seekers have a lot of options. We are really touched by the fact our talented team of employees choose to work here and evangelize on behalf of our unique culture.”</p>
<p>Award recipients were announced at a Hollywood-themed luncheon and ceremony on June 6<sup>th</sup> at the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center. The ceremony presentation included pictures and videos submitted by Headspring employees as a testament to their enthusiasm for the award-winning culture and work environment.</p>
<p>This award comes on the heels of Headspring’s announcement earlier this year to hire two new employees per month in 2012 and to promote the existing twenty-five employees within the company. Headspring is experiencing rapid growth and is set to triple the office’s square footage by moving into the Avalon Building, located in northwest Austin, at the end of July.  As Headspring continues to contract new and larger projects, they vow to preserve a fun and collaborative culture, while planning to hire two new employees per month in 2012.</p>

			Why Try Vi? (Part 1)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Like most people, the majority of my time on a computer has been spent on systems having an O/S with a graphical user interface.  Because I was not raised in the arcane dungeons of the command-line interface, I never [thought I] had any reason to learn to use vi.</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know what vi is, it is a powerful text editor that is built in to pretty much every Unix/Linux-based operating system on the planet.  Even present-day Macs have vi and you can access it from the terminal.</p>
<p>Having watched a proficient Linux user use vi a few times, I concluded that it was originally designed for programmer prisoners of war whose wrists were rigidly shackled to the bases of their keyboards and were therefore unable to reach either the mouse or the arrow keys. And for good measure, were punished for venturing too far from the home row.  I, a free, and enlightened programmer certainly had no use for this nonsense.</p>
<p>Then one day about 4 or 5 years ago, during a .Net boot camp given by <a href="http://blog.developwithpassion.com/">JP Boodhoo</a>, it was revealed to me the true power of vi.  JP coded and refactored so quickly, so effortlessly, it was almost impossible to track what he was doing – and he did this without ever having his hands leave the keyboard.  What was his secret?  It was <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> and <a href="http://www.viemu.com/">ViEmu</a>.  As many of you know, ReSharper is a code navigation, generation and refactoring plugin for Visual Studio.  (If you are not already using it, you are probably shaving months, if not years, off your life performing coding tasks that it can do almost instantaneously.)</p>
<p>The second tool, ViEmu, is a plugin that allows Visual Studio to accept vi commands in its Text Editor windows.  There is a bit of a learning curve, but it is very surmountable and if you take the time to learn it, you will be able to transfer the skill into other computing avenues.  (For instance, in about 5 minutes and for almost nothing, you can set up an Amazon EC2 micro instance to tunnel through your company’s oppressive firewall and look at that Dilbert cartoon that someone sent you a link to.  However, you’ll need to use vi to change the SSH daemon’s port from 22 to 443.  Perhaps I’ll show how to do this in a later post.)</p>
<p>Okay, so how do you make the leap into learning vi?  We’ll take some baby steps and start with something that will make you a more productive web browser right now by installing the Vimium extension for Chrome.  It is available for both Windows and Mac and will be especially helpful if you browse the web on a laptop.  You <em>are</em> using Google Chrome, right?  If you’re not, go ahead and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">install it</a>.  Next, run it and click the little wrench icon and go to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Extensions</strong>.  Browse for extensions, look for Vimium and install it.  When I last checked, it had a 5-star review with over 850 reviews.  It’s got to be good, right???</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/why-try-vi-part-1/vimium-1-med" rel="attachment wp-att-5379"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5379" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vimium-1-med.png" alt="" width="500" height="95" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing you have to learn with vi is navigation.  Vi has five main modes - for navigating (Normal mode), selecting (Visual mode), editing (Insert mode) and searching text, and for executing commands.  Up, down, left, right navigation is performed by the home row keys on your right hand: <strong>h</strong> (left), <strong>j</strong> (down), <strong>k</strong> (up), and <strong>l</strong> (right).</p>
<p>To try these out, open up <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/">http://www.gizmag.com</a> (one of my favorites) and shrink your window so that content on the right is cut off.  Use the <strong>h</strong>, <strong>j</strong>, <strong>k</strong>, <strong>l</strong> navigation keys to scroll the text up, down, left and right.  See?  You’re already making progress towards a carpal tunnel syndrome-free life.  (Did you know, that even without Vimium, Gmail and Slashdot both support some vi keys?  Actually Vimium is disabled in Gmail, but Gmail already has many of its own keyboard shortcut commands which you can see, by pressing the <strong>?</strong> key.)</p>
<p>Probably the coolest feature of Vimium is the ability to navigate form elements and hyperlinks from the keyboard.  All you have to do is hit the <strong>f</strong> key and all hyperlinks and form elements on the page will be decorated with a one or two-letter code.  Just type in the letters and it’s like selecting the form element or clicking the hyperlink.  If you type the letters in lower-case, you will navigate in the same tab.  If you type them in upper-case, you will open the link in a new tab.  That’s pretty sweet, right??</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/why-try-vi-part-1/vimium-2-med" rel="attachment wp-att-5386"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5386" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vimium-2-med.png" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></a></p>
<p>You can press the <strong>esc</strong> key to turn them back off.</p>
<p>The next thing you do frequently in vi is to search for text.  The search mode is activated using the <strong>/</strong> (forward slash) key.  This will cause a small box to appear at the bottom of the screen.  Just type the search string you are looking for and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/why-try-vi-part-1/vimium-3-med" rel="attachment wp-att-5387"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5387" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vimium-3-med.png" alt="" width="200" height="76" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you can cycle through all instances of the search string in the browser text by pressing <strong>n </strong>or <strong>N</strong> to go forward or backward, respectively.</p>
<p>To see the complete list of Vimium commands, you can just press the <strong>?</strong> key, but here are some more of my favorites:</p>
<p><strong>r</strong> – reload</p>
<p><strong>t</strong> – new tab</p>
<p><strong>x</strong> – close tab</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> – previous page in browser history</p>
<p><strong>L</strong> – next page in browsing history</p>
<p><strong>J</strong> – previous tab</p>
<p><strong>K</strong> – next tab</p>
<p><strong>[[</strong> – follow the link labeled previous or &lt;</p>
<p><strong>]]</strong> – follow the link labeled next or &gt;</p>
<p>Using Vimium is a good way to start getting comfortable with vi commands and pure keyboard navigation.  However, the most important thing to take away from this post is that every time your fingers leave the home row of your keyboard, move and click the mouse and come back to the home row to type, you waste precious seconds of your life.  Believe it or not, at the end of the day, week, month, year, it adds up.</p>
<p>Challenge yourself by trying to do as much as possible without leaving your keyboard.  When I was learning to do this (and sometimes I do this when I pair with people) I would take my mouse and put it on the left side of the keyboard, or even behind my monitor.  Only if the action could not be done using the keyboard would I finally go to the mouse.</p>
<p>Trust me, do this for a while and you will truly amaze yourself and others, just as I was amazed when I first saw JP do it.</p>

			Dependency by Required Coincidence</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Software developers talk a lot about dependencies.  Dependencies are necessary, but each one carries with it some intellectual weight that can threaten a system&#8217;s stability over time.  Your code is only as stable as its least-stable dependency, so we need to opt-into them with care.</p>
<p>Usually when we talk about dependencies in .NET, we limit ourselves to discussing the ones that are known statically, at compile time.  Assembly A depends on assembly B because when B is removed, A fails to compile.  Class A depends on Class B because when B is removed, A fails to compile.  The nice thing about such static dependencies is that you can find exactly what lines of code truly depend on the the assembly/class in question: delete it and see what turns all red and squiggly in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s another form of dependency.  It&#8217;s the dynamic and sneaky cousin of our familiar static variety: <strong>Dependency by Required Coincidence</strong>.</p>
<h2>A Gentlemen&#8217;s Agreement</h2>
<p>With a Dependency by Required Coincidence, you are writing code intended to be consumed dynamically in some very precise way by another system.  The agreement only works when you give in completely to the demands of the other system, when nearly every line of the class you control is written with full (or hopefully-full!) knowledge of how the other system will consume it.  When the dynamic consumer doesn&#8217;t provide the behavior you need, it is therefore <em>your fault</em> and you are expected to bend your code around the problem.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong: dynamic languages/platforms/etc are not inherently bad.  It&#8217;s only when some dynamic consumer of your code forces a complex contract upon you that you are in serious trouble.</p>
<p>Does your code take part in one of these &#8220;gentlemen&#8217;s agreements&#8221; with a system that is likely to change or be replaced?  If so, you&#8217;ve got yourself a required coincidence problem.  Your code must contain properties, methods, and types that are unused by the rest of your code but exist because you just happen to know exactly <em>how</em> the other system will require them to exist at runtime.</p>
<h2>MVVM in WPF</h2>
<p>I see this most often when working with the MVVM pattern in WPF applications.  <em>(I don&#8217;t have experience with the MVVM pattern(s) outside of WPF, so for the rest of this post whenever I say &#8220;MVVM&#8221;, assume I mean &#8220;MVVM in WPF&#8221;)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>
  MVVM was designed to make use of data binding functions in WPF to better facilitate the separation of view layer development from the rest of the pattern by removing virtually all GUI code (“code-behind”) from the view layer. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel">source</a>)
</p></blockquote>
<p>This approach seems to have resulted from the following train of thought:<br />
1. I remember having to work with unmainainable code-behinds when I worked with WinForms.  Therefore, code-behinds must be avoided.<br />
2. The defining qualities of code-behinds are that they are code files which can directly access control state and can directly receive controls&#8217; events via public methods.<br />
3. From (1) and (2), accessing control state and receiving events from controls must therefore be bad too.<br />
4. Somebody else had better access control state and receive events for me: a data binding system.  Instead of a code-behind, I&#8217;ll provide a code-behi-… er… a <em>view model</em>.  This will be a class whose properties will describe the data to be displayed, and I&#8217;ll enter into a Required Coincidence Contract with the binding system so that my code will be properly manipulated by the binding system at runtime.</p>
<p>I find the premise here faulty, so maybe I&#8217;ve set up a straw-man argument, but I&#8217;m unaware of motivations for MVVM aside from an aversion to code-behind hell.  Most of us have had to work with painfully-unmaintainable code-behinds, but I hold that these pains weren&#8217;t due to the fact that the code-behind classes access control state and receive events.  Rather, the problems came about when the code-behinds did just about anything <em>else</em>.</p>
<p>This leaves me thinking that we&#8217;ve entered into this elaborate contract with the WPF data binding system just so that we can throw the baby out with the bathwater.  UI controls are inherently stateful/eventy things, and we&#8217;ve opted for a Required Coincidence just to remove stateful/eventy code.  Two examples and their workarounds come to mind:</p>
<p><strong>First, my view model is not allowed to receive events.</strong>  If an item is removed from a list box control bound to one of my collections, WPF will mess with my collection for me.  That&#8217;s all well and good, but when my code just plain needs to react to some interesting event, it may not be covered by the finite list of things that WPF data binding is written to <em>do</em> to my view model.  Furthermore, the binding system admits the importance of &#8220;eventy&#8221; code by requiring me to publish view model state change events so the data binder can receive them!</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can use something like <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/">Caliburn.Micro</a>.  Caliburn.Micro is a third-party framework which builds on MVVM so that you can, among other things, set up a control&#8217;s events to trigger calls against public methods on your view model.  An event handler!</p>
<p><strong>Second, my view model is not allowed to access control state.</strong>  UI controls can be pretty intricate.  Even a lowly text box control has to deal with a lot of possibilities.  By default it will need to handle different kinds of keystrokes, some contributing to the text box content, some highlighting text, some performing other tasks such as cut/copy/paste, or tabbing to another control, etc.  When your application needs to customize the details of a control&#8217;s behavior, you just plain have to have access to its low-level state and events.</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can use an <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/28959/Introduction-to-Attached-Behaviors-in-WPF">attached behavior</a>.  These are classes that are suspiciously/exactly like code-behinds!</p>
<p>With MVVM, WPF isn&#8217;t the Windows Presentation Foundation.  It&#8217;s the Workaround Proliferation Framework.</p>
<p>By surrendering control to the WPF data binding system, we set ourselves up for a nasty surprise the day that WPF falls by the wayside: our view model classes and attached behavior classes will be of absolutely no use to WPF&#8217;s replacement, but they will have absorbed a scary amount of application logic along the way that will have to be rewritten!</p>
<h2>Instability by Required Coincidence</h2>
<p>To sum up, systems like WPF&#8217;s data binding make you enter a Dependency by Required Coincidence.  You must create a great deal of code with hopefully-full knowledge of how the other system will consume it.  Your code is shaped by the thing it indirectly depends on, and may become useless when that unstable dependency is inevitably replaced.</p>
