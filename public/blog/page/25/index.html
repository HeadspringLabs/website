			Overloading on Return Types</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When you define two methods with the same name in C#, they have to take in different argument types in order for them to be distinguished from each other.  Sometimes, I find myself wishing that you could also overload a method name when the inputs are the same, but return types differ.</p>
<p>Technically, you can&#8217;t do that in C#, but you can fake it.</p>
<h2>What would that even <em>mean</em>?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine a hypothetical C# in which you were allowed to overload on return types.  Consider the following class:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891704.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In the call to <code>foo.GetValue()</code>, we cannot tell which method should be called.  However, what if we tried to call it with some more context?</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891706.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>When we have some local type information available, we really could make an unambiguous decision about which overload to call.  When initializing <code>i</code>, the only overload that could work is the one returning an <code>int</code>.  When initializing <code>b</code>, the only overload that could work is the one returning a <code>bool</code>.</p>
<p>We could conceivably find the right overload to call <em>based on how the return value is used</em>.  That seems odd at first, but there&#8217;s nothing really Earth-shattering about it.  Even in today&#8217;s real C#, overloads are picked based on what call-site types we happen to be using, and this would simply be yet another bit of call-site type information at our disposal.  Also, today&#8217;s real C# figures out the type of a lambda expression based on how it&#8217;s <em>used</em> as well, so there&#8217;s a precedent for being able to use usage-site context.</p>
<h2>Using &#8216;out&#8217; Parameters</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s rewrite the original invalid class, using &#8216;out&#8217; parameters instead of return types:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891722.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This is completely valid.  <strong>When picking the right overload to call, the compiler considers &#8216;out&#8217; parameters as if they were inputs.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
  There is no substantive difference between a method that returns some type <code>T</code>, and a <code>void</code> method with an &#8216;out&#8217; parameter of type <code>T</code>.  The difference is only skin deep.
</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Concrete Example</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve encountered this in the real world on a few projects, dealing with the unfortunate interface <code>IDataReader</code>.  This is the interface used to process low-level ADO.NET result sets one row at a time.  Nowadays, most of us access databases with higher-level tools like NHibernate or PetaPoco, but this interface serves as a good example because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) It was written before .NET gained generics, so it has some awkwardly-named methods we&#8217;d like to work around.<br />
  2) Using it leads you to write hard-to-read, monotonous code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these issues will be resolved with the &#8216;out&#8217; keyword.</p>
<p>This interface exposes many methods that take in an <code>int</code> and return a value.  The input <code>int</code> indicates which column of the result set you are interested in, and the method <em>name</em> says what type you hope to find in that column.  <code>reader.GetInt32(2)</code> gives you the <code>int</code> found in the third column, <code>reader.GetDataTime(3)</code> gives you the <code>DateTime</code> found in the fourth column, etc.  To further complicate matters, you shouldn&#8217;t call these methods when the result set contains the special <code>DBNull</code> value.  When using this interface, you end up writing ugly things like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891743.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Note that every time you want call one of these Get* methods, you answer two questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) What type do I expect to find at the given position?<br />
  2) Are null values possible at the given position?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note also that in each line, both of these questions are answered by the declared type of the left-hand-side.  Why should we have to repeat those answers on the right-hand-side?  Armed with some extension methods and the &#8216;out&#8217; keyword, things get much less repetative:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2891749.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re reading in 10 or so columns, the brevity adds up.  When writing a method that needs to read in a record from an <code>IDataReader</code>, you are <em>thinking</em> &#8220;I expect to get back values with these names, at these positions, with these types&#8221;.  You are <em>not</em> thinking &#8220;I expect to pull a Guid out of the first position so I&#8217;ll GetGuid, and I expect to pull an int out of the second position so I&#8217;ll GetInt32 but watch out for DBNull, and&#8230;&#8221;.  By &#8220;overloading on the return type&#8221;, we get to say what we mean <em>and nothing else</em>.</p>
<p>I rarely use &#8216;out&#8217; parameters, but it&#8217;s nice to know they actually have a purpose every now and again, when the need presents itself.</p>

<p><strong><em></em></strong>Austin, TX – June 07, 2012, Austin-based Headspring, a custom application development and consulting firm, today announced it has been recognized as one of the Austin Business Journal’s “Best Places to Work” in Central Texas.  Headspring ranked number four in the Small Companies category of the 2012 list.</p>
<p>Headspring was chosen as one of the top-five Best Places to Work in Central Texas after a series of voluntary employee surveys which examined climate, team atmosphere, benefits and employee engagement. <img title="More..." src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>“It is such an honor to be named one of the 2012 Best Places to Work in Austin,” says CEO/Founder Dustin Wells. “Austin is a rapidly growing city with an expansive job market; job seekers have a lot of options. We are really touched by the fact our talented team of employees choose to work here and evangelize on behalf of our unique culture.”</p>
<p>Award recipients were announced at a Hollywood-themed luncheon and ceremony on June 6<sup>th</sup> at the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center. The ceremony presentation included pictures and videos submitted by Headspring employees as a testament to their enthusiasm for the award-winning culture and work environment.</p>
<p>This award comes on the heels of Headspring’s announcement earlier this year to hire two new employees per month in 2012 and to promote the existing twenty-five employees within the company. Headspring is experiencing rapid growth and is set to triple the office’s square footage by moving into the Avalon Building, located in northwest Austin, at the end of July.  As Headspring continues to contract new and larger projects, they vow to preserve a fun and collaborative culture, while planning to hire two new employees per month in 2012.</p>

			Why Try Vi? (Part 1)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Like most people, the majority of my time on a computer has been spent on systems having an O/S with a graphical user interface.  Because I was not raised in the arcane dungeons of the command-line interface, I never [thought I] had any reason to learn to use vi.</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know what vi is, it is a powerful text editor that is built in to pretty much every Unix/Linux-based operating system on the planet.  Even present-day Macs have vi and you can access it from the terminal.</p>
<p>Having watched a proficient Linux user use vi a few times, I concluded that it was originally designed for programmer prisoners of war whose wrists were rigidly shackled to the bases of their keyboards and were therefore unable to reach either the mouse or the arrow keys. And for good measure, were punished for venturing too far from the home row.  I, a free, and enlightened programmer certainly had no use for this nonsense.</p>
<p>Then one day about 4 or 5 years ago, during a .Net boot camp given by <a href="http://blog.developwithpassion.com/">JP Boodhoo</a>, it was revealed to me the true power of vi.  JP coded and refactored so quickly, so effortlessly, it was almost impossible to track what he was doing – and he did this without ever having his hands leave the keyboard.  What was his secret?  It was <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> and <a href="http://www.viemu.com/">ViEmu</a>.  As many of you know, ReSharper is a code navigation, generation and refactoring plugin for Visual Studio.  (If you are not already using it, you are probably shaving months, if not years, off your life performing coding tasks that it can do almost instantaneously.)</p>
<p>The second tool, ViEmu, is a plugin that allows Visual Studio to accept vi commands in its Text Editor windows.  There is a bit of a learning curve, but it is very surmountable and if you take the time to learn it, you will be able to transfer the skill into other computing avenues.  (For instance, in about 5 minutes and for almost nothing, you can set up an Amazon EC2 micro instance to tunnel through your company’s oppressive firewall and look at that Dilbert cartoon that someone sent you a link to.  However, you’ll need to use vi to change the SSH daemon’s port from 22 to 443.  Perhaps I’ll show how to do this in a later post.)</p>
<p>Okay, so how do you make the leap into learning vi?  We’ll take some baby steps and start with something that will make you a more productive web browser right now by installing the Vimium extension for Chrome.  It is available for both Windows and Mac and will be especially helpful if you browse the web on a laptop.  You <em>are</em> using Google Chrome, right?  If you’re not, go ahead and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">install it</a>.  Next, run it and click the little wrench icon and go to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Extensions</strong>.  Browse for extensions, look for Vimium and install it.  When I last checked, it had a 5-star review with over 850 reviews.  It’s got to be good, right???</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/why-try-vi-part-1/vimium-1-med" rel="attachment wp-att-5379"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5379" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vimium-1-med.png" alt="" width="500" height="95" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing you have to learn with vi is navigation.  Vi has five main modes - for navigating (Normal mode), selecting (Visual mode), editing (Insert mode) and searching text, and for executing commands.  Up, down, left, right navigation is performed by the home row keys on your right hand: <strong>h</strong> (left), <strong>j</strong> (down), <strong>k</strong> (up), and <strong>l</strong> (right).</p>
<p>To try these out, open up <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/">http://www.gizmag.com</a> (one of my favorites) and shrink your window so that content on the right is cut off.  Use the <strong>h</strong>, <strong>j</strong>, <strong>k</strong>, <strong>l</strong> navigation keys to scroll the text up, down, left and right.  See?  You’re already making progress towards a carpal tunnel syndrome-free life.  (Did you know, that even without Vimium, Gmail and Slashdot both support some vi keys?  Actually Vimium is disabled in Gmail, but Gmail already has many of its own keyboard shortcut commands which you can see, by pressing the <strong>?</strong> key.)</p>
<p>Probably the coolest feature of Vimium is the ability to navigate form elements and hyperlinks from the keyboard.  All you have to do is hit the <strong>f</strong> key and all hyperlinks and form elements on the page will be decorated with a one or two-letter code.  Just type in the letters and it’s like selecting the form element or clicking the hyperlink.  If you type the letters in lower-case, you will navigate in the same tab.  If you type them in upper-case, you will open the link in a new tab.  That’s pretty sweet, right??</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/why-try-vi-part-1/vimium-2-med" rel="attachment wp-att-5386"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5386" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vimium-2-med.png" alt="" width="500" height="373" /></a></p>
<p>You can press the <strong>esc</strong> key to turn them back off.</p>
<p>The next thing you do frequently in vi is to search for text.  The search mode is activated using the <strong>/</strong> (forward slash) key.  This will cause a small box to appear at the bottom of the screen.  Just type the search string you are looking for and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/06/why-try-vi-part-1/vimium-3-med" rel="attachment wp-att-5387"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5387" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vimium-3-med.png" alt="" width="200" height="76" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you can cycle through all instances of the search string in the browser text by pressing <strong>n </strong>or <strong>N</strong> to go forward or backward, respectively.</p>
<p>To see the complete list of Vimium commands, you can just press the <strong>?</strong> key, but here are some more of my favorites:</p>
<p><strong>r</strong> – reload</p>
<p><strong>t</strong> – new tab</p>
<p><strong>x</strong> – close tab</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> – previous page in browser history</p>
<p><strong>L</strong> – next page in browsing history</p>
<p><strong>J</strong> – previous tab</p>
<p><strong>K</strong> – next tab</p>
<p><strong>[[</strong> – follow the link labeled previous or &lt;</p>
<p><strong>]]</strong> – follow the link labeled next or &gt;</p>
<p>Using Vimium is a good way to start getting comfortable with vi commands and pure keyboard navigation.  However, the most important thing to take away from this post is that every time your fingers leave the home row of your keyboard, move and click the mouse and come back to the home row to type, you waste precious seconds of your life.  Believe it or not, at the end of the day, week, month, year, it adds up.</p>
<p>Challenge yourself by trying to do as much as possible without leaving your keyboard.  When I was learning to do this (and sometimes I do this when I pair with people) I would take my mouse and put it on the left side of the keyboard, or even behind my monitor.  Only if the action could not be done using the keyboard would I finally go to the mouse.</p>
<p>Trust me, do this for a while and you will truly amaze yourself and others, just as I was amazed when I first saw JP do it.</p>
