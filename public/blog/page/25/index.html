  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Do you really want to know how the sausage is made?</strong></p>
<p>It’s all a matter of perspective. We allow our customers to peek behind the curtain as much as they like, but not all of them want to be involved in the minutae. Want to have a daily check-in call with your team lead? Sure thing. Want to find know what tools we use to automate our regression testing? Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>If I’m in the market for 100 lbs of Boudin, the merchant should probably find out why I’m buying it in order to help uncover which parts of the process I would care about. They’d probably ask a lot of questions.  Are you reselling it? Do you have any allergies? How drunk are your guests going to be? Do you want to see the slaughter-room? Why not? Where are you going?</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The latest YouTube sensation got us thinking about why people quit their jobs. Joey DeFrancesco got help from his marching band to quit his job at a hotel, after 3.5 years of working there, because he said he was treated poorly by management. Joey surprised his manager by announcing his resignation followed by an instrumental celebration, which was filmed and posted on YouTube. His video has received almost 3 million views in 2 weeks. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A4UGtM4hDQ&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;noredirec">View Joey’s instrumental resignation</a>.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/10/array-covariance-in-c">Array Covariance in C#</a>, we saw that a <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> cannot be assigned to a variable declared as <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, even though all <code>Apple</code>s are <code>Object</code>s. If we were allowed to do that, we could get runtime type exceptions as we work with the list contents.</p>
<p>The compiler has to prevent us from these assignments because <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>&#8217;s public interface includes some subtle constraints: <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> is actually a <em>more constrained</em> type than <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>. You can put anything into a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> and get it back out again. You can&#8217;t put just anything into a <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code>; what would you expect to happen when you tried to read it back out? </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This will be my last post on unit test lifecycle management. In previous posts, we <a title="Unit Testing Best Practices: Know your test’s lifecycle, Part 1" href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/08/unit-testing-best-practices-know-your-tests-lifecycle-part-1">learned how individual unit tests and test fixtures are run</a>, and <a title="Unit Testing Best Practices: Know Your Test’s Lifecycle, Part 2" href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/09/unit-testing-best-practices-know-your-tests-lifecycle-part-2">how test invocation is affected when test fixtures are derived from an abstract base fixture class</a>. In this installation, we&#8217;re going to learn how to manage code that runs before and after groups of test fixtures.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you need some code to run before or after a set of test fixtures. I tend to encounter this scenario frequently with integration and system tests. For example, if you&#8217;re using <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> to run your full system tests through the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">Selenium Web Driver</a>, you need to make sure that the Selenium server is running before you run any of your tests. You could do this on the build server by extending your build script with a &#8220;StartSelenium&#8221; task, and then remind all your developers to start the server themselves before they run the tests directly. But wouldn&#8217;t it be better to guarantee directly that, every time those ui tests get run, that the selenium server was active? AND, as a bonus, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if the selenium server was shut down when the tests finished?</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When we first learn about inheritance, we&#8217;re given some plain-English examples with an emphasis on the phrase &#8220;is-a&#8221;. A car <em>is-a</em> vehicle, so a <code>Car</code> class would inherit from a <code>Vehicle</code> class. The idea that class inheritance can so directly map to English is <strong>seriously misleading</strong> and can get you into trouble.</p>
<p>In English, it&#8217;s fair to say that a bag of apples <em>is-a</em> bag of objects. It may have an odd sound to it, but it&#8217;s true. This makes it very tempting to say that in C#, a <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> should be assignable to a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, since all <code>Apple</code> instances are also <code>Object</code> instances:</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was a teen of the 80s, and I have fond memories of that time in my life. The creation of MTV, fashion, music and even the TV shows I watched. However, others might view this as a time of bad hair, horrible fashion and terrible music. I lived through the Reagan Era and Challenger disaster and watched the Berlin Wall come down. I’m part of Generation X, those born around 1960-1976.</p>
<p>The newly conservative age group, 16 percent (about 50,000 people) of the U.S. population in 2009, that was concerned with creating successful futures for ourselves as they focused on college and careers took their world to new heights of material wealth and eventually personal stress. However, the shift in priorities from the social revolutions that captured the attentions of our counter-cultured parents of the baby boom generation also had a huge effect on family values.</p>
<p>My generation, Generation X, witnessed the divorce rate double as our parents embraced the concept as socially acceptable.</div>
