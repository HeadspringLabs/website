			Dallas Day of Dot NET: Get Nerdy With It</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The bags are packed and we’re ready to head out for Dallas Day of Dot NET.  We&#8217;ve heard through event organizers that over 500 people are expected to attend.  Woo Hoo!  Half of our team is going, including President, Jeffrey Palermo, sporting a fresh polo from his recently bestowed and 7<sup>th</sup> consecutive Microsoft MVP title.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/dallas-day-of-dot-net-get-nerdy-with-it/photo-2" rel="attachment wp-att-4036"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4036" title="Katie and Jeffrey heading to Dallas Day of Dot NET" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-2-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/dallas-day-of-dot-net-get-nerdy-with-it/photo-1" rel="attachment wp-att-4037"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4037" title="photo (1)" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-1-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Obviously, we’re super excited about the main event:  keynote speaker Scott Hanselman.  Hanselman is well known for many things, most notably his evangelism for Microsoft and all things .NET.  His popular weekly podcast series <em>Hanselminutes</em> and blog <em>Scott Hanselman’s Computer Zen</em> will be the source of inspiration for his presentation titled <em>Making Your Blog Suck Less</em>.</p>
<p>The posted <a href="http://dallasdayofdotnet.com/dallasdayofdotnet/Home/Agenda">agenda</a> doesn’t include any abstracts. Lucky for you, a few Headspringers are presenting and provided me with their details:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Jeffrey Palermo: </strong><em>Developing for Business Intelligence</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With Microsoft aligning several of its products to serve BI needs, .Net developers are left with little support for providing analytical answers from data stored in system databases.  Even reports are often just formatted query results on a screen.  Business intelligence is about deriving knowledge from your data, not just view raw data.  From fact tables to star schemas to methods of visualization, Visual Studio doesn&#8217;t provide much support for these important and enabling concepts for BI.  This session will introduce developers to the fundamentals of BI development and the basic tools and techniques they can use to start extracting intelligence from their data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Jimmy Bogard: </strong><em>Keeping Integration Sane with NServiceBus</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Building apps used to be simple when we just needed to push data into a database. However, more and more we see our applications needing to communicate with other external applications via REST, SOAP, or for the less fortunate, flat files. We can assume these external services are always 100% up, but inevitably, someone trips over the cord and communication fails. Often, recovering from these kinds of failures are the hardest to recover from, causing developers and the business alike significant heartburn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this session we&#8217;ll examine the common causes for failures integrating with other systems. We&#8217;ll look at the basics of messaging and alternate UI interaction models to accommodate failure. Finally, we&#8217;ll dig in to NServiceBus and see how NServiceBus kicks the problems of flaky integration to the curb once and for all.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Tim Thomas: </strong><em>Building Games with .NET and XNA Game Studio</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em>Developing your own game can be a daunting task. In this session, you’ll see how easy it is to get started from scratch with XNA Game Studio 4.0, the latest version of Microsoft’s multi-platform game creation toolkit. You’ll be introduced to the developer-friendly—and free!—community resources available for building games for the PC, Xbox, and Windows Phone and learn more about this industry-changing game development technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Ryan Vice:  </strong><em>State Management in Windows 8 Metro Applications</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Metro introduces a new application lifecyle in which your application could be terminated at anytime. This example driven session will explore how to write applications that sucessfully manage persisted, session and view state in the Metro environment allowing you to provide a good user experience for your end users. The concepts apply to all Metro development but will be demonstrated using C# and XAML.</p>
<p>After that, Headspringers disperse to “get nerdy with it.”  If you’re in town, plan on stopping by to visit Katie in the sponsor area.  She’ll have swag, stickers, and as always, good conversation.  Pick up one of these beauties for your car bumper, and share the photo on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Headspring/280556282000204">Facebook wall</a>!</p>

			Guest Blog [Muhammad Shujaat Siddiqi]: Defect Density as Estimation Tool</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em>:</p>
<p><em>This article is about defect density as an estimation tool. This attempts to create a simple mathematical model for estimation based on historic defect density about total number of defects and project delivery time. This also presents proposal for creating organizational competitiveness based on defect density of individuals.</em></p>
<p>For historical reasons, defects are generally termed as bugs in Computer Systems Design &amp; Development community.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defect Density Defined: </span></em></strong>-</p>
<p>The simplest definition of defect density is: “<em>The ratio of the number of defects to program size</em>”.</p>
<p>But it leads to a debate about how to measure program size. Some managers define program size in terms of Lines of Code. So according to them, the definition of defect density becomes: “<em>The number of defects per thousand lines of code</em>” i.e</p>
<div align="center">
<table width="255" border="1" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40"><strong><strong>DD = Defects / (K)LOC</strong></strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Others define it in terms of function points. They define Defect Density as: “<em>Defect Density is the number of defect points per hundred function points</em>.” i.e.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="590">
<p align="center"><strong>Defect Density = (Total Defect Points / Function Point Count) * 100</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong></strong>Let&#8217;s agree to both definitions but we want this information to be utilized for help of managers. Managers have to take decisions. For these decisions they do estimation about future events based on past data about current resources. The same principle should be applied for Software Managers. They should have historical data of defect density for code written by each and every software engineer. This data should help them answering questions about future project&#8217;s delivery.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitation of above measures:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong>Function points are a very good measure but, for estimation of defects, it does not consider the present resources (engineers) of an organization. Lines of code may overcome this but I think this measure is not very accurate. I say this because of following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The same functionality can be implemented with different number of total lines of code. Even if two persons write code about the same functionality then the number of lines of code would be different for both programmers.</li>
<li>The numbers of lines of code are different for different programming languages or various code generators.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Programmers have different level of expertise in different programming languages, which results in different bug densities in their code written in different programming languages.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>But the most important point is that most of the code is auto generated code and it is very cumbersome to divide the code of one class to be auto generated or programmer’s written and counts the number of lines for each.</li>
</ol>
<p>So let&#8217;s see if we could come up with a different concept of measuring the defect density which includes software units (forms etc.) and their complexities. Obviously one can also relate them with lines of code. You can also call them Extended Function Points.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defect Analysis for measuring Build delivery time</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Defect Density analysis may also be used to estimate total time it would take for the build to be reaching to the hands of the client. Now this point needs some elaboration. Let&#8217;s consider a typical software solution with a number of modules. We divide our modules in different categories of complexities (ω) for example 1, 2, 3…….. etc. We assign ω = 1 for the simplest software unit (module) and assigns different level of complexities to other units based on their difficulty as compared to the module with ω = 1. For simplicity we keep it discrete but you may have it in decimal numbers as per your convenience. As a matter of fact different values of ω could also mean different lines of code. But the specialty of this design is that the user written code is kept in focus and level of complexity is assigned based on that.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="590">
<p align="center"><strong>Total estimated number of defects = Σ N<sub>i</sub> * D<sub>i</sub></strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Where Ni is the no. of software unit with ω<sub>i</sub> complexity and Di is the Defect density of programmers.</p>
<p>The time of first build to SQA (Software Quality Assurance) is already estimated based on the industry standard estimation techniques. SQA productivity is analyzed by project manager in previous projects by some other density related matrices. The time for fixing for above estimated code can be found out very easily by simple arithmetic. This give total time for this build development, testing and bug removing. So the build delivery time can be estimated using.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Total Time for Build Delivery = Time for build before SQA + Time for SQA phase + Time for defect fixing </strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em><em></em></em></strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</span></em></p>
<p>Now we analyze a build based on the above theory. I have a programmer Shahbaz and his defect density for C#.net is 4.8, 11.3, 19.1 for ω = 1, 2 and 3 respectively. He develops 5 modules having ω = 1, 3 having ω = 2 and 2 having ω = 3. We can estimate the number of defects in his code as follows:</p>
<p>Estimated defects in Shahbaz’s code = 5 * 4.8 + 11.3 * 3 + 19.1 * 2 = 96.1 defects.</p>
<p>If SQA finds out 92 bugs in shahbaz’s code, it means nearly all potential bugs are identified and the build may be delivered to client with confidence.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What’s next?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>With the above calculation we still are not able to tell the build delivery time with sufficient trust because of different critical nature of defects α<sub>i</sub> . We must have some idea about the no. of defects of each critical level. For simplicity, we define three critical classes; they are α =1, 2, 3. The formula for total no. of bugs becomes:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Estimated no. of defects = Φ (N, D) = <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/1" rel="attachment wp-att-3916"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3916" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1.jpg" width="124" height="33" /></a>  (updated)</strong></p>
<p>Where D<sub>ij</sub> is the no. of defects of α<sub>j</sub> criticality on the form of ω<sub>i</sub> complexity and N<sub>i</sub> is the no. of software units of ω<sub>i</sub> complexity. ‘p’ is the limit of complexities defined by your organization and ‘q’ is the levels of criticality of bugs defined.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Time for Defect Fixing</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Here we are more interested in the estimating the time required for fixing of these defects. By simply updating the above formula, we can reach to this:</p>
<p>Time required for fixing bugs = <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/2" rel="attachment wp-att-3917"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3917" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2.jpg" width="142" height="33" /></a> (hours)</p>
<p>where <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/16" rel="attachment wp-att-4015"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4015" title="16" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/16.jpg" width="18" height="17" /></a> is the time (in hours) required for fixing a single bug of α<sub>j </sub>critical nature.</p>
<p>Now you can covert this time in no. of days by dividing the result came out by putting values in above formula by working hours in a day in your organization. If H is the no. of working hours in a day, then:</p>
<p>Days required for fixing of bugs = Ceil <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/3" rel="attachment wp-att-3918"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3918" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/3.jpg" width="177" height="33" /></a> (ideal)</p>
<p>Now use your intuition and add some buffer days for unforeseen incidents. Let <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/17" rel="attachment wp-att-4014"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4014" title="17" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/17.jpg" width="16" height="18" /></a> be the same, then:</p>
<p>Days required for fixing of bugs = Ceil [<a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/4" rel="attachment wp-att-3919"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3919" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/4.jpg" width="177" height="33" /></a>] + <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/5" rel="attachment wp-att-3920"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3920" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/5.jpg" width="16" height="18" /></a>(realistic)</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regression Defects</span></em>:</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Defects can neither be created nor be destroyed but they can change from one form to other. The total number of defects in a module always remains constant</em>.”</p>
<p>This is a joke in software development community and termed as “<em>Law of conservation of bugs</em>”. Although we don&#8217;t believe in this but one thing is for sure that there are defects which might be created while fixing other defects. With the calculations that we did above, these defects may not be included but there should be some other method to estimate them. Due to these defects , very often, we see a number of cycles of builds between development team and QA team. If we do not include this in our estimation analysis then, again, we are underestimating the time.</p>
<p>There are few general observations which should be considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>The no. of defect (N) decreases with each cycle of build between development team and QA.</li>
<li>The level of defect (α) increases with each cycle. Mostly integration issues with other components or development units.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the greatest part of this discussion is to calculate the total number of defects. To estimate this, we proceed as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solution</span></em></strong></p>
<p>It is believed that the no. of defects produced in cycle 2 are all new bugs which are created in fixing other bugs, so they must be lesser than earlier defects. It is believed that they are some percentage of earlier bugs. This should also be kept in mind that this is also different for each engineer.</p>
<p>The formula for total number of bugs should be something like this:</p>
<table width="608" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</table>
<p>Let <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/7" rel="attachment wp-att-3922"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3922" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/7.jpg" width="16" height="20" /></a> percent more bugs are created at each next level than previous level. i.e.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/8" rel="attachment wp-att-3923"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3923" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/8.jpg" width="157" height="22" /></a></p>
<p>Then <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/9" rel="attachment wp-att-3924"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3924" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/9.jpg" width="101" height="22" /></a>, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/10" rel="attachment wp-att-3925"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3925" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/10.jpg" width="110" height="22" /></a>, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/11" rel="attachment wp-att-3926"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3926" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/11.jpg" width="124" height="22" /></a> equation 1 becomes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/12" rel="attachment wp-att-3927"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3927" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/12-300x15.jpg" width="300" height="15" /></a></p>
<p>Solving the above equation we come out to the following conclusion:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/13" rel="attachment wp-att-3928"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3928" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/13-300x53.jpg" width="300" height="53" /></a></p>
<p>We have come to a very nice conclusion but still we are left with a problem i.e. the value of n. How should we figure out this value? This needs some managerial acumen regarding understanding of our engineers and complexity of the project. For a very simple project with averagely competent engineers, this may be as minimum as 2 but for other cases this may go to some very high value. So there are two unknowns; first is the percentage of bugs created in each cycle (<a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/14" rel="attachment wp-att-3929"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3929" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/14.jpg" width="16" height="20" /></a>) and second is the number of cycles (n). This would be different for each team and estimator must take into consideration the history of the team.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Should I deliver my application to clients?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>The managers are often confused when there are bugs in their application and they have to deliver to clients. On these occasions one should repeat the <em>Law of Conservation of bugs </em>(jokingly) and do some measurement analysis regarding these.</p>
<p>On this issue, Maggie Tompkins has presented a very useful measurement technique. She categorizes the bugs into different categories (<strong><em>Fatal Flaws, Critical Concerns, Preventable Problems, Minor Defects and Insignificant defects</em></strong>). She assigns defect points to each category which increases exponentially with each increasing level. This is the same as we defined the level of bugs (α) earlier and assigned values to each level.</p>
<p>The difference is that she measures the defect points in a build and comparing it to the size of project as measured through Function Points based on IFPUG standards, she decides whether the build is ready to be delivered to client or not. I think there are following limitations in this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be hidden defect in the build which could not be found out by SQA. These defects should also be considered when making a decision about build delivery. My discussion is all about estimation after the design and before assignment to individual engineer for the implementation. For this I have presented a complete mathematical model for estimation. What you have to do is to estimate earlier in the implementation phase. After the SQA, you have to analyze whether the defects are as per the expectation or not. If not so, run another cycle until nearly all the dormant defects are surfaced which are up to the quality requirement of the project and organization.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The implementation has to be done by engineers. She has not taken any consideration of the defect history of work done by individual engineers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creating Competitive Organizational Environment</span></em></strong>:-</p>
<p>For an organization to work, manager should create an environment of competitive collaboration between employees of same level in the organization hierarchy. I think defect density can be a great measure for measuring employee’s productivity. Yearly accolades may be offered to the engineer with lowest annual defect density. The formula for measuring defect density at any time may be given as:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/defect-density-estimation/attachment/15" rel="attachment wp-att-3930"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3930" alt="" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/15.jpg" width="229" height="92" /></a></p>
<p>Finally we define defect density according to my model:</p>
<p><strong>“Defect density is the ratio between total unit level defects to total unit level complex components.”</strong></p>

			Make the Most of SXSWi for Free</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The second week of March is upon us, and I could not be more excited.</p>
<p>SXSW Interactive is going to be bigger and better than ever – over 19,000 are expected to attend this year.   I’m really looking forward to being a part of it.  Even the Juggalos will be there!  Juggalos and Bruce Springsteen featured in the same event; I never thought I would see the day.</p>
<p>If you have a badge, make sure to find me and say hello. In between panels, I plan to visit the Microsoft and Beacon Lounges or browse the Trade Show and ScreenBurn Arcade.  Here’s my schedule:   <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/user_events/user_60347">http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/user_events/user_60347</a></p>
<p>However, if you don’t have badge, there is still plenty of opportunity to get in on the action.  Of course, I’ve made a list:</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, March 8<sup>th</sup>: </strong><a href="http://door64.com/sxsw2012">Door64 Pre-SXSW Interactive Party</a></p>
<p>Techies don’t usually need a party to prove how fun they are, but an open bar sponsored by Dell, Intel, and CyrusOne never hurts.  Along with free booze, there will be two bands, and Dell is giving out free laptops and other devices for door prizes. Tickets are cheap ($20) and half off if you’re an Austin Cloud User Goup member.  A steal of a deal!</p>
<p><strong>Friday, March 9<sup>th</sup>:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/301931889872103">Refresh Austin’s SXSW Kickoff Lunch</a></p>
<p>For the fourth year in a row, Refresh Austin has organized an opportunity for folks to mingle and catch up with Refreshers from all over the world.  It’s not sponsored, so you’ll have to pick up your own tab.  However, this is a great opportunity to meet up with badge-holding friends from out-of-town, and convince them to get a job at your company in Austin!</p>
<p><strong>Sunday, March 11<sup>th</sup>: </strong><a href="http://www.eventida.com/events/2012_dewey_ceremony_air-interactive_awards/#SXSWparty">Dewey Awards Ceremony</a></p>
<p>This event is also free, and is co-presented by our friends at Knowbility.  The party will honor 10 media do-gooders with tons of food, drink, and music.  Also, Knowbility will announce the winners for SXSW Interactive AIR.  We’re keeping our fingers crossed for the team of Headspringers that participated in the competition!</p>
<p><strong>Monday, March 12<sup>th</sup>: </strong><a href="http://garann.com/allgirlhacknight/2012/cli.html">Austin All-Girl Dev Brunch</a></p>
<p>The Austin All-Girl Hack Night and Girl Develop It groups have organized a brunch for techie chicks to get together and celebrate their awesomeness.  This year, Headspring is sponsoring because 1) we love All Girl Hack Night 2) we really love the Bloody Mary’s at Frank.  If you’re a girl and you love to code, I strongly encourage you to check this one out. And it’s totally free!</p>
<p>As always, we’ll continue to keep our community events calendar updated with these events and more.</p>
<p>If you know of any other non-badge required events going on during sxswi, please post in our comments.  Happy hunting!</p>

			Why Isn’t Software as Reliable as a Car?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>According to this is a popular <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/41050/why-isnt-software-as-reliable-as-a-car">question</a> on Programmers – Stack Exchange, a user once asked a programmer the innocent question, “Why isn’t software as reliable as a car”?</p>
<p>The highest voted and overly pedantic answer is, “it isn’t: cars themselves have software that is far more reliable than the mechanical parts of the car”. I guess that’s what you get when you leave it to programmers to answer such a question.</p>
<p>Maybe some software is reliable, but I bet you’ve used a custom software system that was far less reliable than your car, haven’t you? I know I have. I’ve built a few them in my past. I’ll take my Honda over some custom software systems any day!</p>
<h2>Why is my custom software system so unreliable?</h2>
<p>Of course, there <em>are </em>several answers, and I <em>am</em> a programmer, so can’t just answer this with a single sweeping generalization. The reason software can be unreliable is as complex as unreliable software is – and therein lies the answer!</p>
<p>At Headspring, we’re big fans of the book “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a>” by Fred Brooks. It’s one of the most important and influential works on the human elements of software engineering. Even our sales and marketing folks have read it – ask them about it!</p>
<p>There are two passages in the Mythical Man-Month that I believe best answer this question.</p>
<h2>Plan to throw one away</h2>
<p>You don’t need to be a vehicle manufacturing expert to understand that to successfully build a new car, you need to go through multiple rounds of designing, prototyping, and testing. Early prototypes are “thrown away” each time until eventually the manufacturer has produced a car that meets all of the design, safety and performance goals. Your Camry is so reliable because it wasn’t the first thing Toyota bolted together.</p>
<p>Yet custom software is often treated differently. “Project after project designs a set of algorithms and then plunges into construction of customer-deliverable software on a schedule that demands delivery of the first thing built. …In most projects, the first system built is barely usable. It may be too slow, too big, awkward to user, or all three.” (Brooks, p.116) You’d never buy a car that was the first prototype out of the design shop, but I bet you’ve purchased or used software that is.</p>
<p>One reason the custom software system you use is less reliable than a car is because its creators likely never planned to throw one away. <em>They delivered the throwaway product to you</em>.</p>
<h2>Complexity and maintenance difficulty</h2>
<p>The other reason software can be unreliable is complexity and maintenance difficulty. “Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any other human construct, because no two parts are alike. …software systems differ profoundly from computers, buildings, or automobiles, where repeated elements abound.” (Brooks, p.182)</p>
<p>It may not seem like it, but in some ways software is orders of magnitude more complex than a car. The mechanics of a car engine are constrained by the physical world in ways that software is not. This complexity also makes it hard to maintain systems.</p>
<p>When a mechanic is changing your car’s oil, you can be confident he’s not introducing a defect in your windshield wipers. When you are repairing a flat, it’s unlikely that you’re going to inadvertently cause your radio to lose its station presets. Because software can be so complex, fixing it is far less reassuring: Brooks suggests that fixing a defect has a substantial (20-50%) chance of introducing another. (p.122)</p>
<h2>Reliable custom software</h2>
<p>If you have a custom software system that you don’t trust as much as your car, I wouldn’t be surprised. Software can be immensely complex and built in a way the nearly ensures a lack of reliability. And for every bug fixed, another one might be introduced. Custom software isn’t for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>At Headspring, reliable custom software is our specialty. We employ <a href="http://www.headspring.com/resources/whitepapers/" target="_blank">agile and test-driven development methods</a> to mitigate the challenges of custom software development. Most importantly, we understand that our job isn’t just to build software, but to deliver satisfaction to our clients. A reliable system is worth little if it isn’t the right one for the job.</p>

			Migrating From Bitbucket to GitHub</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Git and Mercurial certainly have their differences, but in the grand scheme of things they are both equally-viable source control tools.  Bitbucket and GitHub are also both equally-viable hosts for Mercurial and Git projects.</p>
<p>All other things being equal, when it comes to open-source software the Capricious and Arbitrary Popularity Contest kicks in with the deciding vote.  Git, and in particular GitHub, has won the popularity contest in recent years and will own the title of Open Source Thingamabob for the near future.  Something cooler will come along and take its place, but for now GitHub is the place to be.</p>
<p>We still trust Bitbucket with our client work, but we&#8217;re in the process of migrating our open-source projects to the new <a href="https://github.com/HeadspringLabs">GitHub &#8220;HeadspringLabs&#8221; organization</a>.</p>
<p>After a few failed attempts and much gnashing of teeth, I successfully migrated the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/building-rich-enums">Enumeration</a> project from Bitbucket to GitHub, complete with history.
</p>
<h2>Installing Hg-Git on Windows</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re migrating a Subversion project to GitHub, they already provide an simple import service.  They don&#8217;t yet offer a tool for importing Mercurial repositories, though, so I found a Mercurial-to-Git bridge called <a href="http://hg-git.github.com/">Hg-Git</a>.</p>
<p>Hg-Git is intended to let you work continuously against a Git repository while using Mercurial tools on the client side.  I didn&#8217;t need all that, but it can also be used to do the initial push to GitHub from within a Mercurial repository.</p>
<p>The documentation on the Hg-Git&#8217;s main site is a little brief, and after Googling around I found some good advice as well as some good advice that no longer applied.  To get Hg-Git installed on Windows, here&#8217;s all you really need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install a recent TortoiseHg if you haven&#8217;t already.  I used TortoiseHg 2.3 (Mercurial 2.1).</li>
<li>Open a command window and <code>cd</code> to a development folder.  We&#8217;ll be creating some repository folders underneath it:<br />
$ <code>cd C:dev</code></li>
<li>You install Hg-Git by simply cloning its own repository off of Bitbucket:<br />
$ <code>hg clone https://bitbucket.org/durin42/hg-git</code><br />
This creates a new folder named hg-git under the current directory, and underneath that you&#8217;ll see a folder named hggit.</li>
<li>Mercurial needs to be told that this extension exists.  Update C:&#92;Users&#92;&lt;username&gt;&#92;mercurial.ini and add the following (using whatever path you cloned to):<br />
<code>[extensions]<br />
bookmarks =<br />
hggit = C:devhg-githggit</code></li>
<li>Confirm that Mercurial knows what hggit is:<br />
$ <code>hg help hggit</code></li>
</ol>
<h2>Initial Failure</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to have a new empty repository created on GitHub, and you&#8217;ll need to have the rights to push to it.  You&#8217;ll need to have a local clone of the Bitbucket project you wish to migrate.</p>
<p>If you follow the advice on <a href="http://hg-git.github.com">the Hg-Git site</a>, you&#8217;ll try to issue a special &#8221;<code>hg push</code>&#8221; command using a git-specific destination URL.  <strong>This can push the history of commits only partially.  The GitHub repository will unforunately fail to show <em>who</em> performed each commit.</strong>  Yikes.  When I got this far, I had to delete the GitHub repo and start over.</p>
<p>The problem is Mercurial uses one string to represent committer identity while Git uses two (name and email).  Additionally, GitHub pays special attention to the email part, allowing the site to recognize existing GitHub users and linking to their user page.  Since Hg-Git wasn&#8217;t populating email addresses, GitHub had little to go on.</p>
<h2>Successfuly Migrating from Bitbucket to GitHub</h2>
<p><strong>Instead</strong> of using Hg-Git to perform the whole push, we&#8217;ll follow some <a href="http://www.theleagueofpaul.com/hg-to-git">excellent Hg-Git advice</a> that lets us step in to fix committer identities along the way.</p>
<p>That site has a shell script (which can be executed on Windows using the Git Bash command prompt).  The script will use Hg-Git for only one small part of the process: converting a local Mercurial repository folder into an equivalent local git repository.  The only thing wrong with that git repository will be the user names and email addresses.  The script then takes a chainsaw to that local git history, fixing the identity of each committer.  Finally, the script uses regular git commands to do the final push to GitHub.</p>
<p>The downside is that you have to modify this script with a separate chunk for each real-world person that appears in the Mercurial history.  For instance, let&#8217;s say we have history in Bitbucket for users named hgjohn and hgjane.  John Doe has a GitHub account already and prefers to be known there as &#8220;John Doe&#8221; with email address &#8220;john@example.com&#8221;.  Jane Doe doesn&#8217;t have a GitHub account yet, but later on if she does she&#8217;ll want to be known as &#8220;Jane Doe&#8221; and &#8220;jane@example.com&#8221;.  With these transformations ready, we modify the script to the following:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1954240.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>After saving this as &#8220;migrate_hg_to_git.sh&#8221; in our development folder, we execute the following command (all on one line).  This creates a local folder named &#8216;MyProject&#8217;, populates it with a Bitbucket clone, converts it to a Git repository, fixes the names, and pushes to GitHub:</p>
<p>$ <code>./migrate_hg_to_git.sh MyProject https://bitbucket.org/johnd/MyProject git@github.com:jdoe/MyProject.git</code></p>
<p>Now when you view the project on GitHub, John&#8217;s commits display his photo and link to his user page.</p>
