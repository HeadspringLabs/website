		<p>In a perfect world, you build a product that runs smoothly and effortlessly forever.  It is instantly popular, and is built in such a way that it provides a uniform experience no matter whom or how many gravitate towards it.  Users love it just the way it is, and are pleasantly surprised by each new feature or version. Nothing goes wrong, so this product does not require support staff or maintenance of any kind.  You hire a few developers to add new features here and there, and these employees are completely content to stay in one position at your company forever and ever amen.</p>
<p>However, this is not a perfect world.  Your users are real people, all with varying skill levels, intellect, hardware, expectations, moods, etc.  Same goes for the staff you hire to support the product and develop new features.  Ahh… the human factor.</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>, expressions are evaluated lazily by default.  This is quite different from the way most languages behave.  By taking a dramatically different approach to something we take for granted (expression evaluation), you gain the ability to solve problems in different ways.

			Learning to Be a Great Manager</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I first discovered I would be managing a team, I have to admit it was a bit intimidating. After being led by some mediocre managers and a few really bad managers, I wasn’t sure how I would stack up. Was it even possible to be a good manager? Much less a great manager? It has been a little over a month since starting my team and I wanted to document a few nuggets that were taught to me along the way. In no way is this blog the be-all and end-all of flawless management, but I do think that remembering these few crucial points will keep me from being a bad manager.

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For a long time, Kurt Schindler liked the process of creating software much more than coding it.  However, because of his desire to create better systems and process, he needed to continue learning and growing as a developer.</p>
<p>He had been working on an ASP.NET platform since version 1.1, and when ASP.NET MVC came out, he was immediately interested.  He learned more and more, and began to really enjoy the process of software architecture.  He became an active participant on Stack Overflow, and today still ranks in the 10% of users who have answered questions on the subject of ASP.NET MVC.

			Polaroid Mutation</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week, we saw how <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/clojures-world-view">Clojure&#8217;s approach to syntax</a> can influence the way we think while using other languages.  Today, we&#8217;ll see how Clojure&#8217;s strong opinions about state change can similarly affect the way we think in our language of choice.</p>
<p>Some languages embrace mutation (the changing of variables&#8217; values at runtime).  Python and Ruby classes have publicly-settable <em>everything</em> and although this can get you into trouble it can also lead to some pretty slick tools like Ruby on Rails.  Clojure, on the other hand, fears mutation.</p>

Or a view out the window that is more scenic than an asphalt parking lot? If not, you could be leaving creativity behind.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/59-Seconds-Little-Change-Borzoi/dp/0307273407">59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot</a>&#8221; by Psychologist and author Richard Wiseman. The book contains a firehose of fascinating research studies and conclusions aimed to help change your life in under a minute. One passage goes on to detail how much of an impact greenery can have on your workplace productivity.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;An eight-month study of creativity in the workplace conducted by Robert Ulrich at Texas A&amp;M University showed that adding flowers and plants to an office resulted in a 15 percent increase in ideas from male employees and more flexible solutions to problems from their female counterparts.&#8221;

<p>Officially, she is the NHibernate master of Headspring.  However, Anne Epstein has been in web development since 1998.  She has followed its many changes with a close eye ever since. She has achieved what now can be labeled as “adaptive expertise” in understanding how technology changes - and how to change with it.</p>
<p>For all this and more, Anne has proven herself as an indispensable team member at Headspring through careful risk mitigation, attention to detail, and valuable communication skills.

			Clojure&#8217;s World View</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The programming language you use has a very large impact on the way you think about problems. Despite superficial similaries, each language comes with its own set of opinions about what is Important, what is Clean, what is Right, and what is Dangerous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to take a look at the opinions of languages outside of your comfort zone, in case any of those tools can be incorporated into your toolbelt. My language of choice is C#, partly because it has similarly been influenced by a wide range of other languages. You <em>can</em> write Java in C#, but you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to.</p>
<p><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>&#8217;s view of the world is dramatically different from C# and Java, even though it runs on the JVM and can interop with Java libraries. There are two main areas where Clojure can be contrasted with C#: its syntax and its approach to state changes.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll see how Clojure&#8217;s approach to syntax can help us achieve brevity in C#. Next week, we&#8217;ll see how Clojure&#8217;s opinions can shape the way we think about state change.

			3 Redesigns I Love</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Several web redesigns have been coming out recently, so I put together a quick recap of the ones I am most excited about.</p>
<p>1.YouTube</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s redesign focuses mainly around making their channels more attractive to users.  The homepage now features a bar on the left with a list of subscribed and suggested channels, and a feed in the center.  Other featured videos are in a bar on the right, versus front and center on the previous design.</p>
<p>Another great benefit is the long overdue integration with Google accounts and social media.  It&#8217;s no longer necessary for new users to create an account if they have Gmail.  Visitors already logged into their Google account, are automatically logged in when they visit the homepage.  Who needs to remember another log in or password?  Also, Google+ and Facebook get prime spots in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>This video explains all the new features in under two minutes:
