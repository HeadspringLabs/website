<p>Fortunately, we get the best of both worlds from him at Headspring.  He is a really good developer and a really good boss.  In fact, these attributes are symbiotic</p>
<p>Glenn Burnside, Director of Software Development, is an accomplished manager at Headspring because he is supportive, and grants his employees the autonomy to be creative.  He is frequently celebrated for his unwavering support, coaching and guidance.  He has his eye on the prize, and all the confidence needed to motivate our entire development team.  His genuine enthusiasm for the culture of Headspring trickles through the company and everything it touches. The result is happy employees, a happy Headspring, and happy clients.

			Cargo Cult Programming</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>During World War II, Japanese and American troops had to transport a great deal of cargo through the Pacific islands, setting up many short-lived landing strips along the way. Members of tribal societies in the area, who had not seen landing strips and planes before, didn&#8217;t quite understand the <em>how</em> or the <em>why</em>, only the <em>fact</em> that the presence of landing strips and planes coincided with the arrival of supplies. After the war, they would try to build immitation landing strips and planes in the hopes that this would cause new cargo to arrive.</p>
<p>This is an example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a>. The term has since been applied to a wide variety of other topics, when we supposedly-more-advanced people make the <em>exact</em> same mistake. When someone superficially mimics all the trappings of a legitimate scientist in order to support ideas with no scientific leg to stand on, they&#8217;re engaging in cargo cult science. Similarly, when programmers write unhelpful code because it <em>looks</em> or <em>feels</em> like something they ought to be doing, they&#8217;re engaging in cargo cult programming.

			Reduce Stress: Put Down the Zoloft and Start Base Jumping</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have never understood thrill seekers.  People who bungee off of bridges or sky dive or walk on hot coals have always confused me.  Do these people not value their life or their safety?  Most of the time, it seems to me that a thrill seeker is looking for attention, and trouble is the best way to get it.  Furthermore, what astonishes me the most about thrill seekers are their cool and carefree attitudes.  Thrill seekers often put themselves in the most dangerous situations, and yet they are generally more relaxed than Nervous Nancy who always keeps herself safe.  Why?</p>
<p>After watching the documentary, <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/programs/killer-stress/">National Geographic: Stress – Portrait of Killer</a></em>, I finally understand.  In fact, I may be a convert.

Since you&#8217;re already reading this blog, you are probably most familiar with his weekly blog <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/plioi">series</a> for Headspring.  He holds the title in our office for top technical blog author.  Patrick has a strong attention to detail, and this character trait is quite evident in his writing.  But blogging is just what Patrick does in his spare time.  Along with writing, he is also a dedicated developer</p>
<p>He picked up programming with Pascal as a teenager, and never looked back.  “I knew right away that I wanted to write software for a living,” he says.  Patrick is most interested in programming languages and compilers. In fact, he is an all-out expert with C#, focusing on the lesser-known corners of the language.  He has used C# on a wide variety of projects since its initial release, including an open-source text parsing library named <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley">Parsley</a>. He&#8217;s also using Parsley to experiment with a language of his own, <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook">Rook</a>, which should be ready for public consumption, “Sometime around the heat-death of the universe.”

			Losing Yourself in the Data</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Statistics are king when trying to figure out why something matters, but statistics are God when you need to get an audience of data-driven minds on the same page. I’ve come to this conclusion by being a marketer in a developer’s world.</p>
<p>Often I find myself thinking, “I just know that solution y will solve problem x,” but knowing that will not be enough to convince my fellow developer teammates. Now I am not saying that I’m not swayed by a good statistic, but I can usually be influenced by a trusted teammate&#8217;s feelings, intuition, or experience. Being a D personality (from the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/improve-corporate-culture-through-the-disc-test" target="_blank">DiSC Personality Profile</a>) a statistic to me is no more than a luxury when trying to make quick decisions.

			Continuous Integration: Early Indicators Mean Inexpensive Fixes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Earlier this year, I bought a car—my first <em>new</em> car. Although it fills me with sanctimonious hybrid glee (it really does), it&#8217;s making me neurotic with instrument panel indicator lights. The low-tire-pressure indicator after the weather turned cold. The insistent exclamation point from the airbag computer in my seat. The glaring amber beacon from the Integrated Motor Assist battery. I&#8217;ve never had so many things go wrong with a car!</p>
<p>Or have I?</p>
<p>Incorporating automated tests into your Continuous Integration build process can feel similar. You&#8217;re suddenly presented with all these errors. Your product seems to be broken all the time. You liked it better when things were quiet and you didn&#8217;t know how bad it was.

			Strategic Planning: Writer&#8217;s Block</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The end of the year is traditionally an optimal time for strategic planning.  Although, planning can often feel like the most daunting task to be sandwiched between holiday vacations and family feasts.  There are so many excuses for putting it aside and focusing on tasks with more immediate impact.  Furthermore, there is no plan yet to execute, so writing one involves sharpening knives and awakening your Mojo.  Good ideas have a funny way of hiding themselves behind a blank page.  When faced with this internal attitude, first remember the golden rule of planning:  you are not guaranteed success with a plan, but without one, you are sure to fail.  It&#8217;s best to get started sooner than later. Once you have brainstormed ideas, strategic planning is just a matter of outlining your format and explaining your thoughts.
