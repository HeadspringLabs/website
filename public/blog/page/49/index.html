			What Did the Interrupting Cow Say?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Moo!</p>
<p>Everyone hates to be interrupted – even people who do it themselves.  It’s rude and can leave a bad impression on any person.  It’s worse than bad breath!  Interrupters are often labeled by their victims as selfish, careless, mean, know-it-alls.   Confronting the problem can be awkward, at best, and can sometimes lead to an even more hostile situation.</p>
<p>I have heard this phrase associated with interrupters, “Hate the attitude, not the person.”  However, that’s only half of it. The word attitude has a bad connotation, and it indicates an incorrect assumption about interrupters.  The truth is those who interrupt are well intentioned people.  Often times, all they want to do is help.  It’s not likely that this person is thinking anything about you personally in the moment they are interrupting you.  It’s still rude and impolite, but it’s not necessarily mean.  Therefore it is very important to remember first not to take it personally when you are interrupted.  A little understanding goes a long way.</p>
<p>Think of the other ways in which you experience interruptions, and you may feel more comfortable with managing the nuisance.  Your thoughts are constantly being interrupted by ringing phones and email notifications.  Conversely, sometimes our pesky thoughts can interrupt daily tasks.  Have you ever put a book or an email aside because you had a nagging thought about where you placed your phone? We respect these instinctual interruptions because they have a good purpose.  Verbal interruptions are easier to get upset about, but can also serve a good purpose.</p>
<p>People who verbally interrupt are everywhere, and we all have to work with them.  In fact, it can be a good thing.  Many successful business people are hailed for their quick-thinking skills. Their processes are not linear, and that is an indicative characteristic of creativity.  An interrupter has the ability to think and express themself differently, which should be recognized as a benefit when those features are utilized in the appropriate environment.  Instead of ignoring or resisting these people’s thoughts or ideas, try using them.  If a chronic interrupter breaks the pattern of a brainstorming exercise, try thanking them.  Say something like “Thank you. Would you mind holding on to or writing down your thought, so we can discuss it?” By keeping things positive, you will have the opportunity to cultivate the interrupters thought and get the conversation back on track without creating tension.</p>
<p>What are some other ways that your office copes with interruption?</p>

			Recognizing Covariance Issues in Your Code</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My last three posts have covered the nuts and bolts of the little-used <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/10/array-covariance-in-c">Array Covariance in C#</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/10/seamless-generic-type-casting">Seamless Generic Type Casting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/seamless-delegate-type-casting">Seamless Delegate Type Casting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The examples have all been small, and a little contrived, so you may not yet recognize when you need to fetch this tool from your toolbelt. Today, I&#8217;ll cover a real covariance problem I ran into while developing <a href="http://github.com/plioi/Parsley">Parsley</a>, an open-source text parsing library.</p>
<p>The goal of parsing is to convert plain text into a data structure that can be more easily traversed and reasoned about. You want to describe the patterns of what valid input looks like, as well as describe what objects should be created when those patterns are found.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s example, we&#8217;ll be parsing <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> text into the corresponding arrays and dictionaries that JSON describes. Parsley&#8217;s integration tests include <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley/blob/91394b0f17606aea9a583ae49249da3567c53298/src/Parsley.Test/IntegrationTests/Json/JsonGrammar.cs">a JSON parser</a>. <strong>Without the <code>out</code> keyword, this sample parser would fail to compile with some pretty suspicious error messages.</strong></p>
<p>The most important types defined in Parsley are <code>Parser&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Reply&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1355343.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>A <code>Lexer</code> (aka tokenizer) inspects the input plain text and converts it to a series of tokens. If we&#8217;re parsing JSON, tokens would be things like a constant, a keyword, or a puctuation symbol like [ or {. A <code>Parser</code> is any object which can consume some tokens and produce a <code>Reply</code>. A <code>Reply</code> contains the parsed object (if the input was valid), the remaining unconsumed tokens, and possibly some error messages.</p>
<p>Parsley lets you take <em>small</em> parsers that do part of the effort, and glue them together into larger parsers that do the full parsing effort. Like regexes, the glue involves repetition (&#8220;zero or more of <em>that</em> pattern&#8221;), alternation (&#8220;any one of these possible patterns&#8221;), and sequencing (&#8221;<em>this</em> pattern, followed by <em>that</em> pattern&#8221;).</p>
<h2>Repetition</h2>
<p>For repetition, we have helper functions that take in a <code>Parser&lt;T&gt;</code> and output a new <code>Parser&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. The new parser will repeatedly recognize whether the pattern appears again, consuming it until the pattern is no longer recognized. The overall <code>Reply</code> will contain an object for every occurrence of the pattern:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1355353.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Alternation</h2>
<p>For alternation, the <code>Choice</code> helper function takes in several <code>Parser&lt;T&gt;</code> and returns a new <code>Parser&lt;T&gt;</code> which recognizes when <em>any one</em> of those patterns appears next in the input text:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1355357.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Sequencing</h2>
<p>For sequencing, I <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/09/the-compilers-treatment-of-linq-syntax">redefined the <code>from</code> and <code>select</code> LINQ keywords</a> to provide the <em>sequencing</em> operation, gluing together small <code>Parser</code>s into a larger <code>Parser</code>.</p>
<p>In part of the JSON parser, we need to recognize the pattern of a single key/value pair for a dictionary. Such a pair is a quoted string, followed by a &#8216;:&#8217;, followed by some other JSON value. The result of the Pair rule is an object containing the relevant parts of that sequence:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1355360.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>The result of a query like this is <em>yet another</em> <code>Parser</code>. Each <code>from</code> clause consumes a little more input, and the <code>select</code> clause describes the combined result of those intermediate steps.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>At one point, before the <code>Parser</code> and <code>Reply</code> types used the <code>out</code> keyword, I ran into some surprising compiler errors. I <em>wanted</em> to write the following:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1355386.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Just to satisfy the compiler, though, I had to write this instead:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1355856.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In order to pass <code>Array</code> and <code>Dictionary</code> to the <code>Choice</code> helper method, they needed to have the same type as each other. In order to satisfy the compiler after that, I was having to also include explicit <em>upcasts</em> in the <code>select</code> clauses. <strong>That is just <em>weird</em>!</strong> Have you ever had to explicitly upcast, just to satisfy the compiler? As if an array or dictionary <em>might not</em> be an <code>object</code>!</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>When the compiler surprises you, the most direct path to getting a successful compile isn&#8217;t necessarily the right answer. First, try to understand what the compiler is trying to tell you. Ask yourself, &#8220;What is it about my code that the compiler is getting tripped up on? Why isn&#8217;t it making the decision I expected?&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Taking a closer look, these queries result in values of type <code>Parser&lt;object[]&gt;</code> and <code>Parser&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;</code>, respectively, and we&#8217;re trying to assign them each to a <code>.Rule</code> property of type <code>Parser&lt;object&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We <em>want</em> to treat any <code>Parser&lt;Child&gt;</code> as a subtype of any <code>Parser&lt;Parent&gt;</code>, whenever <code>Child</code> is a subtype of <code>Parent</code>. When we look at the <code>Parser&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Reply&lt;T&gt;</code> definitions, we see that the Ts always appear in the return types, never in the input types. The <code>out</code> keyword is therefore applicable here, with the desired results:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using <code>Choice</code> no longer has the suspicious side effect of requiring less-descriptive types for each rule we happen to pass to it.</li>
<li>The compiler no longer needs us to include suspicious explicit upcasts in our select clauses.</li>
</ol>

			Improve Corporate Culture Through the DiSC Test</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>
<p>A variety of personalities exist in the workplace and being able to collaborate with teammates efficiently is important for a company’s success. While routines and personalities become clearer the longer employees work together, it’s also helpful to know and understand the behavioral styles of other employees and learn how to adapt to them. The DiSC Assessment is a personality test that focuses on behavioral and personality situations and is an effective tool and guideline for the workplace to use. </p>
<p>The results are productive for yourself to assess where you are, where you want to be and how you can better communicate with others, especially your teammates and customers. The assessment is also productive for your teammates because they learn your how to best work and communicate with you.</p>
<p>At Headspring, we have employees take the DiSC test when they first join the team and we use the results in our day-to-day interactions. It not only improves our team dynamic, but it helps us understand each other and our thought processes.</p>
<p>After a short questionnaire, the assessment groups you into one of four groups:</p>
<p><strong>Dominance</strong> (D) – Individuals in this group focus on control and like getting immediate results. These individuals are also direct, fast-paced, driven and strong-willed.</p>
<p><strong>Influence</strong> (I) – Individuals in this group focus on social situations. They are motivated by social recognition and being influential to others. These individuals are enthusiastic, optimistic, convincing and trusting.</p>
<p><strong>Steadiness</strong> (S) – Individuals in this group focus on structure. They are motivated by opportunities to help and stability. These individuals are patient, calm, stable and consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance</strong> (C) – Individuals in this group focus on accuracy. They are driven by quality work and knowledge. These individuals are careful, tactful, systematic, and cautious.</p>
<p>Although we all have each of the four groups in us, there is usually one dominate group in each person that has a bigger presence in the way we act. While the DiSC assessment is not the end all of having the most efficient office, it’s a good reference and starting point in improving the work relationships and team building. Curious about your results and want to learn how this assessment can improve your corporate culture? Read more on <a href="http://www.discprofile.com/">DiSC</a> and consider taking the assessment for yourself.</p>

			Tips on Managing Organizational Change</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Growing and evolving companies encounter many changes over time. Shifts in leadership, policies, new structures, targets, acquisitions, disposals, re-locations, etc., all create new systems and environments and are just a few of the organizational changes a business can go through. Although these changes might be implemented for continued growth and success, change is typically hard to deal with - especially if your team is already incredibly busy.  Resistance will probably occur – it might even occur from the person or management team who initiated the organizational changes in the first place. Remember, change of any kind is typically met with resistance. However, for a company to reach the next level or continue on the road to success, change is usually inevitable. How does a company endure and manage organizational change to keep the company from falling apart? In order to minimize difficulties, we think the key is communication. Communicate. Communicate. And then communicate some more. This will help ensure your team will not only understand, but also want to be part of the <a title="Reasons Why People Break Up…With Their Company" href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/10/reasons-why-people-break-upwith-their-company" target="_blank">big painted picture</a>.</p>
<p>Any type of organizational change needs to be explained to your entire team as clearly as possible. This might also take some follow up communication for weeks or even months after the new changes are proposed and implemented – think meetings, memos, one-on-one meetings, etc. to ensure everyone is grasping the big picture. This will also ensure your teams involvement in validating and/or refining the changes. Part of open communication means being open to listening to your team’s input. When explaining or presenting new organizational changes, avoid expressions like <em>mindset change, changing people&#8217;s mindsets </em>or<em> changing attitudes</em>. This language often indicates an imposed or enforced change, and it strongly suggests the company believes its team currently has the <em>wrong </em>mindset, which is never want you want to portray and it’s never the case. If people are not approaching their tasks or the organization effectively, then the organization has the wrong mindset, not the people.</p>
<p>How your managers communicate and participate is crucial to the change process. I repeat. How your managers communicate and participates is crucial to the change process. Your management team should enable and facilitate through communication and leadership, not just convey and implement policy from above, which does not work. You cannot impose change. Your teams need to be empowered to find their own solutions and responses, with facilitation and support from the managers. Open and frequent communication is the best way to make sure this happens. There also needs to be tolerance and compassion from the leaders and executives. This will help your team trust the organization and employees need to be able to trust the organization.</p>
<p>Following these tips will ensure any company going through organizational change can do it with success. Although there will be some challenges, open, frequent and effective communication can make this transition a lot smoother.</p>

			Seamless Delegate Type Casting</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/10/seamless-generic-type-casting">Seamless Generic Type Casting</a>, we saw how the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> keywords can make our generic interfaces polite with respect to casting. A <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> can be treated as an <code>IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;</code> because a) all strings are objects and b) <code>IEnumerable</code> is declared with the <code>out</code> keyword. Now, we&#8217;ll see how these keywords can be applied to delegate types in addition to interface types.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a a basic hierarchy of entity classes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1339376.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Also, suppose we find ourselves creating/persisting many instances of these in our integration tests, and we create a delegate type with some helper methods for doing so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1339379.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In our integration tests, we may use this to quickly get some sample employees into our database:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1339417.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>As we write some tests, we realize that we need some of our sample employees to be populated differently:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1339420.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Surprise! This won&#8217;t even compile. The compiler can&#8217;t assign our <code>EntityCreator&lt;SalesPerson&gt;</code> to the expected type <code>EntityCreator&lt;Employee&gt;</code>. That&#8217;s strange, since we know that any <code>SalesPerson</code> it ever makes will <strong>obviously</strong> be an Employee. As we saw with similar situations around interfaces, we need to use the <code>out</code> keyword when we define the delegate type, promising to the compiler that the <code>T</code> will only appear in the return value. Armed with this additional promise, the compiler can safely treat all <code>EntityCreator&lt;FieldTechnician&gt;</code> as <code>EntityCreator&lt;Employee&gt;</code>. With the following change, the example compiles as expected:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1339421.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
