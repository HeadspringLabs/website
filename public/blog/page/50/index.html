			Reasons Why People Break Up…With Their Company</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The latest YouTube sensation got us thinking about why people quit their jobs. Joey DeFrancesco got help from his marching band to quit his job at a hotel, after 3.5 years of working there, because he said he was treated poorly by management. Joey surprised his manager by announcing his resignation followed by an instrumental celebration, which was filmed and posted on YouTube. His video has received almost 3 million views in 2 weeks. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A4UGtM4hDQ&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;noredirec">View Joey’s instrumental resignation</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to relationships, people and their jobs don’t always work out. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported more employees left their jobs voluntarily than were laid off in 2010. Here are some reasons reported why people quit their jobs or are seriously considering resigning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>They couldn’t stand their boss</strong></li>
<li><strong>Job Stress</strong></li>
<li><strong>The company was struggling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Better opportunities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Being stretched to the limit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Boredom</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Below are a few tips that we follow that have led to a positive impact for our employee retention efforts:</p>
<p>Studies have shown people thrive in positions where they feel they are contributing and making a difference. Employees like to be part of the big picture plan to help the company succeed, so let them know what the big picture plan is and how their role will directly impact the company getting there.</p>
<p>Employees also like to know they have a career path laid out for them at your company. Make it clear about what it takes to progress in your company. Career progression also includes salary and benefits, which will help keep employees engaged and happy.</p>
<p>Get regular feedback from your employees. Ask how you’re performing or, if appropriate, send an anonymous survey to understand what your employees think about their jobs, the company, your performance, etc. Often people don’t leave the companies, they leave poor managers. Have regular formal or informal catch-ups with your employees to gauge where they are.</p>
<p>Are there things or tips you’ve seen or are doing in your company to help employee retention?</p>

			Seamless Generic Type Casting</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/10/array-covariance-in-c">Array Covariance in C#</a>, we saw that a <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> cannot be assigned to a variable declared as <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, even though all <code>Apple</code>s are <code>Object</code>s. If we were allowed to do that, we could get runtime type exceptions as we work with the list contents.</p>
<p>The compiler has to prevent us from these assignments because <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>&#8217;s public interface includes some subtle constraints: <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> is actually a <em>more constrained</em> type than <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>. You can put anything into a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> and get it back out again. You can&#8217;t put just anything into a <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code>; what would you expect to happen when you tried to read it back out? Therefore, <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> is more constrained than <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> and we can&#8217;t treat <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> as a subtype of <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s tempting to ask, is there some other generic type <code>Foo&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>Foo&lt;Apple&gt;</code> <em>can</em> be treated as a <code>Foo&lt;Object&gt;</code>? <strong>It turns out the answer is yes!</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say your application is sending messages to another process over a message bus, and that you&#8217;ve implemented a helper method that sends a whole collection of messages instead of just one:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1321180.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won&#8217;t even compile. We&#8217;re trying to send a list of <code>RemoveOrderLineItem</code> messages, but the <code>SendAll</code> method accepts a <code>List&lt;IMessage&gt;</code>. Fortunately, this starts to compile if we change the definition of <code>SendAll</code> to receive an <code>IEnumerable&lt;IMessage&gt;</code> instead of a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1321168.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>What&#8217;s so <em>special</em> about <code>IEnumerable&lt;IMessage&gt;</code> that lets us seamlessly cast from a <code>List&lt;RemoveOrderLineItem&gt;</code>? Remember, the reason that the compile originally failed had to do with the fact that the object we were passing to <code>SendAll</code> had more constraints than the type declared on the receiving end. With <code>IEnumerable&lt;IMessage&gt;</code>, it&#8217;s a different story. Now, the only thing that <code>SendAll</code> can do with our collection is get values out of it, and we know all such values will be individually compatable with <code>IMessage</code>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re able to do this because, as of .NET 4, <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> has an updated definition:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1321170.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>The <code>out</code> keyword was added to the generic type parameter <code>T</code>. Using this keyword is a promise. <strong>&#8220;I promise that for all the members in this interface, <code>T</code> will only appear in the return types, never appearing in any inputs.&#8221;</strong> When we use the <code>out</code> keyword, we&#8217;re saying that T is &#8220;covariant&#8221;.</p>
<p>The <code>in</code> keyword makes a similar promise: the type parameter <code>T</code> could appear in the types of input arguments, but never in the return types. When we use the <code>in</code> keyword, we&#8217;re saying that <code>T</code> is &#8220;contravariant&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition to sanity checking your promise, the compiler is now free to treat any <code>IEnumerable&lt;RemoveOrderLineItem&gt;</code> as a <code>IEnumerable&lt;IMessage&gt;</code>, without having to cast each individual item first. <code>IEnumerable&lt;RemoveOrderLineItem&gt;</code> is truly a subtype of <code>IEnumerable&lt;IMessage&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Introducing these two keywords to the language was a nonbreaking change, with the main effect being that people encountered fewer compiler errors, usually without knowing it. When you design your own libraries, consider whether your interfaces deserve to take part in this style of casting. Beware, though, that <em>removing</em> the keywords later on can be a breaking change from the point of view of your library&#8217;s consumer!</p>
<p>In my next post, we&#8217;ll see how these keywords can be used to glue together delegates.</p>

			Unit Testing Best Practices: Know Your Test’s Lifecycle, Part 3</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This will be my last post on unit test lifecycle management. In previous posts, we <a title="Unit Testing Best Practices: Know your test’s lifecycle, Part 1" href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/08/unit-testing-best-practices-know-your-tests-lifecycle-part-1">learned how individual unit tests and test fixtures are run</a>, and <a title="Unit Testing Best Practices: Know Your Test’s Lifecycle, Part 2" href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/09/unit-testing-best-practices-know-your-tests-lifecycle-part-2">how test invocation is affected when test fixtures are derived from an abstract base fixture class</a>. In this installation, we&#8217;re going to learn how to manage code that runs before and after groups of test fixtures.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you need some code to run before or after a set of test fixtures. I tend to encounter this scenario frequently with integration and system tests. For example, if you&#8217;re using <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> to run your full system tests through the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">Selenium Web Driver</a>, you need to make sure that the Selenium server is running before you run any of your tests. You could do this on the build server by extending your build script with a &#8220;StartSelenium&#8221; task, and then remind all your developers to start the server themselves before they run the tests directly. But wouldn&#8217;t it be better to guarantee directly that, every time those ui tests get run, that the selenium server was active? AND, as a bonus, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if the selenium server was shut down when the tests finished?</p>
<p>Another case where this need shows up is in database-coupled integration tests. These kinds of tests often suffer from unintended order dependencies - one set of tests end up assuming that some data introduced by an earlier set of tests will be present in the database, and then those tests fail if you run them in isolation.</p>
<p>Another approach I often see people take is to have a &#8220;special&#8221; test fixture  that performs all their database initialization and initial data loading. That test fixture might look like this:</p>
<p>[gist id=1313334 file=SampleDataLoader.cs]</p>
<p>The Explicit attribute means that the test fixture is not run if you execute all the tests in the assembly by default. Typically a test like this would be run by invoking the nunit console runner from an automated build to run only tests in the &#8220;DataLoader&#8221; category.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not bad, but again - what happens on developer system when you forget to run the dataloader tests first? Or, what do you do when you&#8217;ve got different sets of tests that need different default data? You definitely don&#8217;t want each individual test or fixture going through an entire, scorched-earth style recreation of the entire database just to get to a clean state, do you?</p>
<p>Fortunately, NUnit provides a not-well-known, but powerful, soltuion for executing code before and after <em>any</em> tests run - the SetUpFixture. It doesn&#8217;t have the greatest name in the world, as it&#8217;s easily confused with TestFixtureSetup. The difference is that SetUpFixture runs around <em>all</em> the fixtures within the same namespace. SetUpFixture classes defined outside of a namespace will run before any tests in the entire assembly. Here&#8217;s a sample:</p>
<p>[gist id=1313334 file=SetUpFixtureSample.cs]</p>
<p>Which produces this output:</p>
<p>[gist id=1313334 file=SetUpFixtureSampleOutput.txt]</p>
<p>As you can see, the SetUpFixture classes exhibit the same nesting that we&#8217;ve come to expect from constructors, Dispose methods, SetUp, and TearDown atributes. As with basic test fixtures, I recommend that you use the construct/dispose pattern for SetUpFixture classes, and avoid the SetUp and TearDown-attributed methods. There&#8217;s no need for the extra layer of initialization.</p>
<p>Also note that SetUpFixture class construction and disposal is nested by namespace. If you have two of them in the same namespace though, order of execution between the two could be non-deterministic.</p>
<p>One of the great things about these SetUp fixture classes is that they run whenever tests in the same namespace are executed, regardless of how many tests within that namespace you happen to be running. The important thing is that your context of execution is always going to be firmly established, even if you&#8217;re only running one test. Andy, by establishing the right part of your entire testing context at the right leve, you can dramatically decrease the test time for expensive tests. For example, you could rebuild the whole test database in a SetUpFixture defined at the assembly level, and then establish and remove different sets of test data for related tests, organized by namespaces. This might look like this:</p>
<p>[gist id=1313334 file=SetUpFixtureDatabaseExample.cs]</p>
<p>Which of course produces the following output:</p>
<p>[gist id=1313334 file=SetUpFixtureDatabaseExampleOutput.txt]</p>
<p>The outermost SetUpFixture ensures that you always start from a known state, by dropping and rebuilding the test database. We open up a transaction within the namespace SetUpFixture&#8217;s constructor, and roll it back in the corresponding Dispose method. This technique can help ensure that your integration tests don&#8217;t develop unintended order dependencies by relying on data injected by other, previously run tests. Once all the tests in that namespace have run, all the database changes get rolled back. Now the next set of tests can start from a known data state again.</p>
<p>SetUpFixtures, by virtue of being run outside of, and around, all of your unit test fixtures, give you a lot of options in structuring the runtime context in which your unit tests execute. They can be a very powerful tool in your testing toolbelt. Hopefully this introduction to NUnit SetUpFixtures gives you some ideas on how you can re-structure and streamline your own test management - especially for those more challenging scenarios, like UI and integration tests.</p>

			4 Growth Strategies for Your Evolving Business</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Entrepreneurs are constantly looking for business growth strategies, especially when the business is evolving and improving. Here are four things to help lead entrepreneurs on the best path to growth and success and examples of how we implement these strategies at Headspring.</p>
<p><strong>1. Improve your leadership</strong></p>
<p>Review how you lead your team and find opportunities to improve it. The solution could be classes or getting involved in professional organizations to help you learn new best practices. Do you meet with each employee on a regular basis? You could also change your review process with your employees and find new ways to support them.</p>
<p>At Headspring, employees meet with their supervisor for a one-on-one once a month. This is a chance to discuss anything the employee or supervisor wants to. This is also a great way to encourage a collaborative and team environment.</p>
<p><strong>2. Review your business goals</strong></p>
<p>As your business evolves, your end goal may evolve also. It’s important to periodically review your business goals to keep your focus and actions aligned. Is your company still on the right track to success or do you need to shift the goals? Take in consideration your progress so far and where you want to be in the future.</p>
<p>Every quarter, our entire company meets to discuss the company’s goals, evaluate where we are, and discuss where we are headed. Then, we go spend time outside of the office doing something fun – i.e. rock climbing, laser tag, Segway tours, etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. Diversify your offerings</strong></p>
<p>Expand and diversify your offerings based on your clients’ needs. What other services or products can you offer? Think about how you can improve your clients’ experience or meet their needs. Complementary products, educational webinars and white papers or internal improvements of processes with clients can help improve and grow your business.</p>
<p>Our developers and team frequently develops open source projects, hosts numerous training and education seminars and focus on providing systems that will help our clients’ businesses grow.</p>
<p><strong>4. Develop the skills of your employees</strong></p>
<p>Are your employees improving their skills and continuing their education? When your employees improve and expand their skills, it allows them to improve their quality of work at your company, which will make your company more successful. Your company can offer company educational or seminar days for your employees or you can provide your employees with a list of options, such as classes offered in your city or educational events employees can attend.</p>
<p>We continuously encourage and support mastering a skill. We’ve built in CI time daily for employees and host peer learning lunches, which allow them to focus on anything they choose that they want to master and share what they’ve learned with the entire office.</p>
<p>What business growth strategies do you use?</p>

			Array Covariance in C#</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When we first learn about inheritance, we&#8217;re given some plain-English examples with an emphasis on the phrase &#8220;is-a&#8221;. A car <em>is-a</em> vehicle, so a <code>Car</code> class would inherit from a <code>Vehicle</code> class. The idea that class inheritance can so directly map to English is <strong>seriously misleading</strong> and can get you into trouble.</p>
<p>In English, it&#8217;s fair to say that a bag of apples <em>is-a</em> bag of objects. It may have an odd sound to it, but it&#8217;s true. This makes it very tempting to say that in C#, a <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> should be assignable to a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, since all <code>Apple</code> instances are also <code>Object</code> instances:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1302300.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>The sample above won&#8217;t compile. The compiler is protecting us from potential runtime type exceptions. If this compiled, we could get into trouble like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1302301.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>If this compiled, we would be able to attempt to put a string into a collection that simply does not support that operation. The English metaphor for inheritence (<em>is-a</em>) just doesn&#8217;t adequately match the actual constraints of the type system. We&#8217;re trying to violate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>. If we declared that <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, we&#8217;d be saying that <em>every</em> operation that acts on a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> could be given a <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code>, and that&#8217;s simply not true. In our example, the operations performed on the <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> included putting new arbitrary objects into the list, and you just can&#8217;t do that to a <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Because <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> has more constraints than <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> is not assignment-compatible with <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the previous example <strong>does</strong> compile when you replace <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> with supposedly-strongly-typed arrays. Instead of knowing that you&#8217;ve done something wrong at compile time, you get an exception at runtime:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1302325.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Because <code>TChild[]</code> can be assigned to <code>TParent[]</code> for any <code>TChild</code> inheriting from <code>TParent</code>, we can say &#8220;arrays in C# are covariant&#8221;.</p>
<p>To sum up, <code>List&lt;Apple&gt;</code> can&#8217;t be treated as <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> <em>because of the operations that <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> provides</em>. The question, then, is could we ever safely take advantage of this convenient funky-casting for <em>other</em> generic types? The answer to this question falls under the category of &#8220;Covariance and Contravariance&#8221; and is provided by the C# 4 keywords <code>in</code> and <code>out</code>. In my next post, we&#8217;ll cover an example where this funky-casting is both convenient and safe.</p>
