			The Null Object Pattern in C# and System.Lazy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This post is going to cover a pair of topics that aren’t truly related, but topics that I like to use together. When combined they can give you a nice pattern. First I’m going to briefly talk about the Null Object Pattern:</p>
<h3><strong>The Null Object Pattern</strong></h3>
<p>Rather than dealing with uninitialized variable instances, you can start off by assigning a variable to an instance of a “Null Object”. Oftentimes you’ll see this done when developers assign an empty string to a variable because they don’t want to deal with null values. I’m going to be discussing this with types that are a bit more complex than string.</p>
<p>In the code snippet below, I have represented a method with an optional argument that will fall back to an “empty” signature if one isn’t supplied. This Empty property is our Null Object for Signature that provides a safe instance we can use instead of dealing with null.</p>

			Publishing a Library to SymbolSource.org</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week, we saw how to <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/publishing-a-library-with-nuget">publish a library with NuGet</a>.  By including DLL files in our NuGet package under the special &#8220;lib&#8221; folder, NuGet knows to install them as assembly references in the target project.  This is a great way to get your open-source library into the hands of your audience, but it also provides them with a pretty lame debugging scenario.

<p>Outside of one six-month period at my last job, I’ve always shared an office with my boss.  It’s not easy.  In fact, it’s not really that easy to share work space with anyone.  Obviously noise is an issue – noisy talking, breathing, typing, eating etc.  With a boss, noise is even more difficult to cope with because usually your preferences come second to theirs.  Also, sharing work space with a boss grays boundaries of the appropriate use of time and conversation.  You have to be on time (all the time), constantly focused, and prepared to smile politely <em>for every interruption.</em>  Furthermore, the two of you are much more exposed to each other’s shortcomings than anyone would prefer. Your boss is there to micro-manage every conversation or task, and you are there to witness every breakdown or breach of authority.</p>
<p>Here are some important facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your boss wants personal space too</li>
<li>You’re probably not going to get it</li>
</ol>
<p>So…

			Add a Little Func to Your Tests</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yes this is a lame title, but it made me chuckle. I thought I’d share a quick shortcut that good ole Func&lt;&gt; provides as an alternative to a private method.</p>
<p>With Func&lt;&gt; it’s easy to clean up tests. Let’s assume you need to test a query that returns a list of books in a particular genre.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2015251.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>By creating a Func&lt;&gt; to set the properties on an object, it shortens the test and makes it much more readable. Obviously if you have more than one test that needs new books, then I&#8217;d recommend using a private method. If you&#8217;re wondering about the .ShouldEqual or .ShouldBeTrue in the test, I&#8217;m using the <a title="Should Assertion Library" href="http://nuget.org/packages/Should" target="_blank">Should Assertion Library</a> because I like the readability.

			The Confusion Around QA: Why Doesn’t the Industry Agree?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Most people in the industry are undoubtedly familiar with the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/CPT-SystemLifeSycle.svg/500px-CPT-SystemLifeSycle.svg.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Reference: Wikipedia</p>
<p>I was having lunch with a recruiter colleague, and I was learning about the QA requests from lots of customers.  Most defined the QA role well within the “Testing” oval as shown in the picture.  From my questioning, it appears that the agile movement has done little to alter this SDLC.  In fact, this process is still alive and very will, even within agile teams.  The difference is in the batch size.  Rather than doing analysis on a batch of 50 features and then moving that full batch to design, the agile movement has reduced that batch size considerably, and in some cases reduced it down to a batch size of 1.  Lean agile teams are likely to use a batch size of 1 and continuously pull features through the lifecycle.  As an aside, I find that even when working on a single feature, this cycle is still in play, although the feature is more likely to jump backward and redo a portion of the phase before if new information is found.

		<p>Last week, we saw how to <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/publishing-a-simple-nuget-package">publish a simple NuGet package</a>.  When installed into your solution in Visual Studio, that package would copy some text files into the target project.  That&#8217;s convenient, but it isn&#8217;t a typical use case for NuGet.  Instead, you usually want to publish compiled assemblies, and you want installation to add those assemblies to the target project&#8217;s list of assembly references.

<p>The system built was like the ones I’ve always built, with the caveat that there was very little in terms of a user interface. Instead, customers never interacted directly with the application, and we received notices of external events (and then notified others) through a variety of integration patterns, including:

			Onion Architecture: Part 4 - After Four Years</a>

		<p>In 2008, I coined a new pattern name called Onion Architecture.  You can read the previous parts here: <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-2/">part 2</a>, <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-3/">part 3</a>.  Over these four years, I’ve spoken about this pattern at user groups, conferences, and it’s even published in one of the chapters of <a href="http://manning.com/palermo3">ASP.NET MVC in Action</a> from <a href="http://manning.com/palermo3">Manning</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been overwhelmed by the traction this pattern name has enjoyed.  Folks from all over the country have written about and have talked about the pattern.  Some of the ones I’ve noticed are here (please comment with more – I welcome it).

<p>Printers are a terrible bane on my existence, and I have made a purpose to rid myself of needing them at all. I have come to realize that I am not alone in this grievance, and going on without the need for a frustrating printer is no longer a difficult task. Google Docs, EchoSign and a whole host of other cloud-based offerings have significantly reduced our reliance on printers, and they have added years back to my life.</p>
<p>But this post isn’t <em>all</em> about how much I hate printers – it’s old news. I work for a technology company, and technology is about new news.
