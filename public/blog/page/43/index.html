			Get to Know a Developer: Ryan Vice</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/get-to-know-a-developer-ryan-vice/img_8187" rel="attachment wp-att-3089"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3089" title="IMG_8187" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_8187-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This week’s spotlight is on Ryan Vice, one of our newest Principal Consultants at Headspring.  He is currently in the final stages of authoring, <em>MVVM Survival Guide for Enterprise Architectures in WPF and Silverlight</em>.  Here is our conversation:</p>
<p><strong>What led to you focusing on WPF?</strong></p>
<p>During my time at Money Management International, I was the Workflow lead and that position included the responsibility for both the workflow engine and the related user interface components.  During that time I became active on the MSDN Workflow Foundation forums and was one of the top answerers throughout that year. This lead to me being offered a slot at Houston’s Tech Fest, which lead to blog content which then lead to me receiving Microsoft MVP award in connected systems. Once that project had wrapped up I couldn’t find any other projects on Workflow Foundation which I really enjoy and so I looked for projects in WPF which is also a XAML based WinFX technology. At the time I was looking to specialize in WinFX and continue to try and increase the level of my contributions to the development community around WinFX.</p>
<p>For my next project I ended up as an architect for the <em>Street Smart Edge</em> application at Charles Schwab.  <em>Street Smart Edge</em> is a high volume system with around 40000 concurrent users for active traders (day traders) with a high portfolio size requirement.  The application has rich UI needs because these types of traders tend to work on multi monitors that are being feed by real time data. The project was using WPF and this is where I really got to dive in deep. During my time there I evangelized MVVM and was then tasked with refactoring our code base to use MVVM (Model View View Model) pattern. There were a lot of challenges both in evangelizing and implementing this pattern and I ended up compiling a good bit of research on the topic and even had an opportunity to work with Sam Bent who leads WPF’s data services team that invented the binding system that makes MVVM an attractive option. Well this ended up leading to my book deal with Packt and the whole thing has its own momentum now as I have spent my weekends working on the book and talking at whatever conferences and user groups will have me in an effort to evangelize the XAML and MVVM.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your experiences as a Project Lead.</strong></p>
<p>My first lead was at Money Management where I was put in charge of the workflow parts of the call center application for managing clients through credit counseling that we were building. On my next project at Charles Schwab I was hired as a senior programmer in the final year of the three year project.  I came in at a time when there were around 40 contractors from all over the world and 20 full time employees on the project.  It was a really exciting project and I ended up getting promoted to architect with two other full time employees who had 10 years with the company. It was a real honor for me to be singled out in that way. I’m really proud of that and of Street Smart Edge, as it’s a really nice piece of software that really shows off what you can do with WPF. After Charles Schwab I got a contract working on the rewrite of <a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">www</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">.</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">support</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">.</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">dell</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">.</a><a href="http://www.support.dell.com/">com</a> in ASP.NET MVC as a consultant manager. This project was my first time managing an offshore team, also first time on ASP.Net MVC and I got my first taste of working in a really large SOA environment. It was a fun project and learned a lot of valuable skills.</p>
<p>Leading teams is something that I really enjoy and now that I’m at Headspring and working with such talented engineers it’s just a real honor to be trusted with that responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>You have a lot of experience with technical contributions.  How do you choose what to focus on?</strong></p>
<p>I’m a tinker and I’ve always got projects going on things that I find interesting.  Before Workflow, WPF, and Silverlight, it was skateboarding lifestyle projects.  Before skateboarding projects it was computer animation.  I’ve found that for me the formula to do well at things is finding things that I have passion for. As a kid growing up I looked up to professional athletes and thought about how cool it’d be to be a pro and have skills that are respected. Well once you get to an age that you realize that’s not your calling you can still “go pro” and earn some respect in your profession and I really feel that, just like in sports, passion and drive are key to excelling. Fortunately for me, with programming physical skill isn’t a determining factor…</p>
<p><strong>Skateboarding? How did that fit into tinkering projects?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t spend as much time on it anymore, but I used to be heavily involved in Texas skateboarding.  In fact, when I was living in Houston I was really involved with it. People don’t realize it but Texas is really on the map in the skateboard community and I started doing local web zines in Houston to practice my programming but also mix in my other areas of interest. This lead to me and a friend starting a short lived print magazine about skateboarding called “Status”.  We did four issues together and distributed about 20,000 copies throughout the south.  It wasn’t a money maker but it was definitely something that meant a lot to me and we ended up with a team of about 15 or so on the last issue including a full design team.  I ended up learning a lot about graphic design, photography, project management, sales, client relationships and web development during that time.</p>
<p><strong>So what is your biggest accomplishment so far?</strong></p>
<p>Personally, building a happy family with my wife, and professionally, writing my first book.  Learning backside tail slides in my 30s is up there too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			When Does a Loyalty System Do More Harm Than Good?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Chances are, if you’re reading this you’re a member of at least one loyalty program. While the days of the key ring with a dozen fobs are fading into the rear view mirror, the proliferation of rewards programs won’t be stopping any time soon. As an original member Burger King kids club (I was the one with the green sunglasses and skateboard) I’ve seen a lot of really cool loyalty programs, and I’ve also seen some really ineffective ones. A poorly executed loyalty program can alienate your most valuable customers, and cost you a hell of a lot of money doing it. Here are the most common mistakes that companies make.</p>
<p><strong>1. They discount the wrong things</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a baseball team, don’t offer discounted season tickets as one of your perks. I had one National League Executive tell me “Season Tickets are by definition a loyalty system. We’re already rewarding them for volume purchases.” Think about your high margin items by offering a discount on parking or concessions.</p>
<p>There are always going to be loopholes in whatever discounts you give. I watch extreme couponing. I remember the grocery store paying my dad to buy cornflakes. Extra-plain Cornflakes that I had to choke down every morning for a year. Give incremental discounts that are large enough to be noticed by your customers, but not on bread-and-butter products that they make the COO roll his eyes in company meetings.</p>
<p>A great example of this is a national grocery chain that discounts its bulk coffee. They’re already making solid margins on this line of business, but their customers have no real compelling reason to keep their coffee purchases in-house. The grocery chain came up with a stair-step program where customers could “unlock” a 10% discount by purchasing a predetermined amount of coffee. This kept margins high, and increased the volume 30% of a profitable part of their business.</p>
<p><strong>2. They spam their best customers</strong></p>
<p>I love it when Drugstore.com reminds me that I have a bonus $10.00 in Drugstore cash that I need to burn before the end of the month. You’re never going to make an enemy by doing that. I’ve noticed that they contact me most frequently when they have good news for me, and keep the “check out our ‘Brand X’ line” emails to a maximum of once a quarter. Yep, I take advantage on their sales, but I also stay loyal and buy from them every time instead of chancing it with another, less reputable website that might save a couple of bucks here or there.</p>
<p>There are a few lists that I’ve been on that have felt like spam right from the get-go. This usually happens when I get put on a list halfway through a marketing campaign that unbeknownst to me was started a month beforehand. I get a bunch of messages with their company-specific jargon and catch-phrases that I just don’t understand. I feel disconnected from the company and I won’t have any second-thoughts about unsubscribing. The best companies are the ones who have one or two emails for people who have just joined their club to ease them in. Take me out to dinner first.</p>
<p><strong>3. They overestimate how involved their customers want to be</strong></p>
<p>Every day I see a car with an “Apple” sticker on the window. Not every company out there has a loyal enough following to the point that their customers will turn their cars into moving billboards. Don’t assume that clients will wear your swag just because you have a happy customer. It doesn’t mean that you won’t get to that point, just don’t make the mistake of thinking that you’re more involved in your customer’s lives than you really are.<br />
Case-in-point- DIRECTV. I’ve been a subscriber for a few years and I get sick of their constant emails. I even get sick of hearing that they’ll give me a hundred dollars for referring a friend. I buy all kinds of extra packages from those guys, but their customer service is just so difficult that I will never be excited to hear from them. I fall into the category of “once there are other options for Sunday Ticket, I’m out.” Yet somehow, I get calls from them, packages of stickers, and emails 4 times a week (including the ones that tell me that prices are rising on my next bill.)</p>

			ToString, or Not ToString</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the first things people learn about .NET is that every Object can be turned into a string by invoking ToString(), and that this method can be overridden.  This method gets overridden for several different <em>reasons</em>, which kind of muddies the waters.  Sometimes it&#8217;s overridden so that the object can be rendered for the user&#8217;s eyes, and sometimes it&#8217;s used to output debugging information for the developer&#8217;s eyes.  By default, it simply gives the namespace-qualified type name.</p>
<p>While stepping through in debug mode, the debugger frequently needs a string representation of your objects so they can be displayed in a grid.  When in doubt, it calls ToString(), which suggests that we Ought To Use ToString() For That, leading to an inconsistent use of the method.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have an alternative to ToString() for debugging purposes.  When a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x810d419.aspx">[DebuggerDisplay]</a> attribute is included on your class, you can tell the debugger to use something <em>other</em> than ToString().  The documentation for this attribute lists many caveats and includes a suggested pattern to follow in order to avoid trouble:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1563243.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>If you have a class that deserves a special debugger-only representation, you can follow this pattern.  First, place [DebuggerDisplay(&#8220;{DebuggerDisplay,nq}&#8221;)] on the class.  Then, provide a private read-only string property, also called DebuggerDisplay.  This property can return whatever you want, but to avoid surprises at debug time you probably want to define it in terms of read-only state.</p>
<p>DebuggerDisplay&#8217;s single string argument can support a wide variety of expressions, but &#8220;{DebuggerDisplay,nq}&#8221; is all you really need to ever use.  It simply means, &quot;Display the result of the DebuggerDisplay property, with <strong>N</strong>o <strong>Q</strong>uotes&#8221;  Anything more complex, and you&#8217;re asking for either performance problems, or language incompatability problems.  We mark the property as private to avoid polluting our public interface, but that&#8217;s OK since the Debugger Knows All and Sees All.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Sharon Cichelli</a>

		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/get-to-know-a-developer-sharon-cichelli/img_5586" rel="attachment wp-att-3027"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3027" title="IMG_5586" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_5586-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Sharon Cichelli will try to convince you that she is not a “girlie-girl”, but don’t fall for it.  I have yet to see a single, unaccessorized day in the life of Sharon, Senior Consultant at Headspring, and author of <a href="http://www.girlwritescode.com/">Girl Writes Code</a>. She is even a regular attendee and sometime presenter for a community group named <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Austin-All-Girl-Hack-Night/">Austin All-Girl Hack Night</a>.  However, there is no convincing Sharon, that in spite of her coolness, she&#8217;s good at being girlie.</p>
<p>Getting to know her this week proved to be a very enjoyable experience. I wish that I could share our full conversation, but that would require a series in and of itself. Here are some highlights:</p>
<p><strong>What is your biggest accomplishment so far?<br />
</strong>With my teammate Josh Flanagan, we convinced the process-entrenched Dell IT department to let us try (and succeed with) the first sanctioned agile project at Dell. We had to convince our fellow developers (including the ones overseas), system architect, project manager, test lead and testers, business analyst, internal customers, manager, senior manager, director, and the team that governed the project management process to use Scrum instead of Waterfall for planning and tracking deliverables. We enjoyed many successful, predictable deployments and unprecedented stakeholder engagement. Most projects at Dell today use an agile project management approach.</p>
<p><strong>What is the best invention in the past 50 years?</strong><br />
Open Source and Creative Commons as a means of sharing and building upon intellectual property. For example, consider the following progression, which would have been impossible under restrictive patents: The Processing programming language, built based on Java and designed to be accessible to non-software engineers, inspires the Wiring programming language and environment, which is used by the Arduino microcontroller (which is open-source hardware), which is the brains in a MakerBot 3D printer. Because these inventions were released as open source, successive teams built new innovations, culminating in an affordable hobbyist printer that makes plastic widgets!</p>
<p><strong>What tools or technology are you really interested in?</strong><br />
The Arduino microcontroller, and open-source platform for prototyping electronics projects. I&#8217;ve given a few talks and hands-on hack sessions about the Arduino, written some blog posts, and I post my Arduino code to Github.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also excited about JavaScript and CSS again. The UI layer had gotten muddled for a few years, but it is vibrant, fun, and full of potential now.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your most prized possession?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m really grateful to have a house that I share with my husband. I&#8217;m growing asparagus in the backyard. Digging in the dirt makes me feel, well, grounded.</p>
<p><strong>When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong><br />
A novelist. When I was little, I didn&#8217;t keep a diary; I wrote a memoir, which my nine-year-old self was certain would be published posthumously and assigned in English classes, based on the importance and emotional depth of my other published works. Dream big.</p>

			Technical Debt: How Much Interest Are You Willing to Pay?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In a perfect world, you build a product that runs smoothly and effortlessly forever.  It is instantly popular, and is built in such a way that it provides a uniform experience no matter whom or how many gravitate towards it.  Users love it just the way it is, and are pleasantly surprised by each new feature or version. Nothing goes wrong, so this product does not require support staff or maintenance of any kind.  You hire a few developers to add new features here and there, and these employees are completely content to stay in one position at your company forever and ever amen.</p>
<p>However, this is not a perfect world.  Your users are real people, all with varying skill levels, intellect, hardware, expectations, moods, etc.  Same goes for the staff you hire to support the product and develop new features.  Ahh… the human factor.</p>
<p>And then maybe you experience an error or two. Maybe the server shuts down. Maybe your new versions aren’t always compatible. If you’re really lucky, maybe you get hacked. Oh joy!</p>
<p>So, you code.  You code something that will fix the problem.  You code something to patch over what you are dealing with so you don’t have to deal with it again.  Each time you duct tape over a problem with code, it’s as if you have charged the problem to your technical credit card.</p>
<p>The correlation between technical complexity and debt was first proposed by<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham"> </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">Ward Cunningham</a> in 1992.  Basically, technical debt is the result of trying to fix problems too quickly, without regard for long term consequences.  In my opinion, this nasty cycle stems from our culture of instant gratification.  Software organizations want to fix problems quickly because they don’t want to lose impatient end users. “Fix it; I don’t care how.”</p>
<p>User experience is your most important priority; you don’t want to tinker around with too many questions while the server is down.  However, keep in mind that quick fixes accrue interest.  Piecing a whole system together with quick remedies as you go along is a lot like only paying the minimum payment on your balance. Sometimes, a little bit of debt is okay, as long as you are willing to pay the monthly balance back in full. What I mean by that is you will need to look at the problem in terms of the big picture eventually.</p>
<p>You have to be willing to roll your sleeves up and pull out the engine at some point.  The root of the problem is in there somewhere.  Take a little bit time up front.  When you can, pay for solutions with cash instead of credit.  This means investing your <em>time</em> in looking at how the problem affects the whole system.</p>
<p>How does your organization highlight technical debt so you can go back and deal with it?</p>
