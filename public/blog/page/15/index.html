  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of my first job out of college was spent doing desktop development, some of which was in VB6.  I didn&#8217;t love it, but it was easy to learn.  When <em>this</em> button is clicked, <em>that</em> function runs in response to it.  Easy.</p>
<p>The controls-and-event-handlers model combined with the language also made it exceptionally easy to create a tangled pile of misplaced responsibilities, but I think you&#8217;ve got to experience that kind of pain before you can see that alternatives even <em>exist</em>.  Once you&#8217;ve felt the pain, you can better-evaluate which guidance is actually going to be helpful.<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not long a go, I wrote a detailed blog post on <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb">getting started with RavenDB</a> and described the process of performing the most basic CRUD (create, retrieve, update, and delete) operations. The operations covered in the post are great for working with single data entities. One thing I didn’t discuss was how to retrieve a set of data entities and that is exactly what I want to dive into here.</p>
<p>Retrieving data from RavenDB is dead simple and the .NET client offers excellent support for LINQ based queries. Let’s start by reviewing the IDocumentSession interface:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2153059.js'></script>

</p>
<p>The query method in the interface is the gateway to retrieving sets of data and offers three signatures which give us immense flexibility with our queries.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the Query&lt;T&gt;() method! Beginning with the example context…</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Perfectionist (my rough definition):  Someone who wants to always do things without errors or mistakes, without considering the costs incurred or likelihood of attainment.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article I share my personal struggles with unproductive perfectionism in my work.  I point out how much “true perfection” really costs, and that it often isn’t even possible.  I discuss why overcoming perfectionism is important, and share some strategies I’ve found useful for balancing passion and perfectionism.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Nolan and I’m a recovering perfectionist.  I love software development and I’m very passionate about what I do.  The problem is, sometimes I care too much and passion turns into perfectionism.</p>
<p>I started thinking about this after my first post.  I was checking it to see if there were any comments I needed to respond to.  I’d written the article over a week before it was published, so I casually glanced over it.  While reading I suddenly realized I’d completely left a word out of a sentence.  I was mortified.  I’d proofread it at least three times and had gotten someone else to look over it.  How could this have happened?  My first blog post and I’d failed to do it “right”.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Text is easy.</p>
<p>Source control tools slice and dice text all day.  It&#8217;s easy to compare, easy to merge, and easy to compress.  Even in a busy project, large portions of your code don&#8217;t really change all that often.  Git, for instance, can pretend to store every commit as a point-in-time copy of your whole source tree by <a href="http://progit.org/book/ch1-3.html">sharing large unchanged blobs</a> of text with other commits.</p>
<p>Text is easy.  Binary is tough.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>In this post we will be discussing how DbContext API helps us in validation of entities in Entity Framework Code First workflow. The API allows various options to define validation of entities and their properties. It also makes it easier to execute these validations providing validation results. We are going to be using some basic entities in a simple Institute and introduce various forms of validations using different options available in the framework. The whole intent is to learn these available options. In a real world example you might be more or less inclined to be using any of these options.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I was pondering a new topic to blog, I stumbled into one this morning. I was running some ideas by a few Headspringers, and they provided several options. I decided to go with a hybrid of their suggestions. What I originally planned to blog was a way to test Enumeration subclasses of the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/headspringlabs/tarantino/wiki/Home" target="_blank">Enumeration class from Tarantino</a>. What I ended up with was an even better way to test them. This is not an unusual happenstance at Headspring. If you talk to other Headspringers, you’re going to learn something new. It never ceases to amaze me how often I’m learning something. I like to think I’m doing some teaching, too, but I’m confident that I’m currently learning more than teaching.</p>
<p>In case it isn’t clear by the title, part of becoming a Headspringer is to learn from the great people you get to work with every day. So, if you&#8217;d like the opportunity to work with talented, passionate people, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/about-us/careers">we are hiring!</a></p>
<p>Now let’s get to the original idea of testing the Enumeration subclasses. I will walk through my original code, then what <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/get-to-know-a-developer-brandon-barry">Mr. Brandon Barry</a> showed me, and why it’s an improvement.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>New Space Will Preserve Culture While Expanding Staff Levels and Service Offerings </em></p>
<p><strong>AUSTIN, TX – April 9 , 2012</strong>, Headspring, an Austin-based custom software consultancy, will triple their square footage as they move into a new office space in the Avalon Building, located in northwest Austin.  As the privately funded company continues to contract new and larger projects, they vow to preserve a fun and collaborative culture, while planning to hire two new employees per month in 2012.<img title="More..." src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>The signed lease comes on the tails of President Jeffrey Palermo’s search to satisfy all employee requests for new office amenities.  “It is important that we continue to foster a creative and collaborative environment for our consultants.  I solicited requests from the team - from natural lighting, to nearby eateries, to covered parking.  I even mapped out the most ideal commute according to everyone’s residential address,” said Palermo.</p>
<p>Headspring continues to attract the attention of Texas companies, large and small, after experiencing monumental growth in 2011, which included 47 percent growth in revenue and 162 percent increase in clients.  As a result, the company is in the process of promoting current employees – five promotions so far in 2012 – and increasing staff levels by hiring two new full time positions each month.</p>
<p>“We are really looking forward to this move. A larger space means we can offer more to our team members, clients, and community,” says CEO Dustin Wells. “Expanding allows us to reach more people on our mission to solve the hardest problems and provide the most maintainable software solutions.”</p>
<p>As Headspring leads the way in project consulting and developer training, its new space, which went from 4,233 sq ft. to 11,319 sq. ft., will contain eight conference rooms for project teams to host clients and utilize as presentation and meeting space.  Also, the training room will seat up to 100 people, allowing instructors to offer the acclaimed educational courses to a larger audience, and more space for employees to host community events. Headspring’s first training session in the new office space will be its HTML5 Boot Camp open to developers nationwide.</p>
