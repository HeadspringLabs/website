			Mentorship and Pie Potential</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This past summer, the Headspring staff took a trip to <a href="http://www.k1speed.com/austin-location.html">K1 Speed</a> for a quarterly meeting.  When we weren&#8217;t &#8220;testing the safety equipment&#8221; around the track, we were talking about our performance for the quarter as well as plans for the future.  We were asked to imagine a much larger Headspring 1-2 years out, and describe what it would take to get there.</p>
<p>I shared a hard truth, suggesting we start considering more recent grads in our hiring process.  This may seem counter-intuitive.  Hiring talented folks for software development is extremely tough, and real-world experience matters a lot when evaluating candidates, right?  On the flip side, though, most experienced software developers have a long list of horror stories from past jobs: office politics, bureaucracy, teams spread too thin, death marches, and the like.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be great, for both you and the new hire, if they got to skip all that luck-of-the-draw stuff and instead got <em>all</em> of their real-world experience at a healthy company right from the start?</p>
<p>From a candidate&#8217;s point of view, they could enter the workforce surrounded by experienced people who have already faced and rejected all those problems.  They could learn from everyone&#8217;s example far more quickly than they would otherwise on their own, and they wouldn&#8217;t run the risk of being set <em>back</em> by the examples of struggling teams.</p>
<p>In reaction to my suggestion, I was asked to take on a mentorship role with a current student, with the goal of preparing him for an internship here at Headspring.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way things work here: if you make a suggestion to improve things, don&#8217;t be surprised if <em>you</em> get to make it a reality.  In light of this policy, next time I think I should share another hard truth with the team: <strong>we need to be eating more cakes and delicious pies</strong>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve only been meeting for a few weeks, but it&#8217;s already a rewarding experience for both of us.  Once per week and for about an hour, Dan and I meet to bring him up the C# / MVC learning curve.  When we first met at a <a href="http://www.polyglotprogrammers.org/">Polyglot</a> meeting, Dan had some experience with C++ and Lua, but hadn&#8217;t worked with C# yet.  Our initial meetings have focused on the nuts and bolts of C# itself, but even early on we got to cover other topics such as automated testing, readability concerns, the DRY principle, etc.</p>
<p>On the selfish side of the equation, this experience helps me to improve my own skills.  Having to explain things that I take for granted forces me to challenge my own assumptions, and improves my ability to discuss complex technical subjects with clients.  On more than one occasion, Dan&#8217;s questions have left me initially thinking to myself, &#8221;<em>Why</em> exactly, do I feel so strongly about this opinion?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have appreciated having a mentor at that age, but filling the opposite role is looking to be a pretty sweet deal.  Not as sweet as my cake/pie suggestion, but sweet nonetheless.</p>

			Jack Welch MBA Course: Business Communication and Ethics</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Earlier, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/jeffrey/jack-welch-mbaa-new-graduate/">I wrote</a> about my experience at the <a href="https://twitter.com/jack_welch"><a href="http://www.jwmi.com">Jack Welch Management Institute</a>.</a>&nbsp; One of the courses in the program is Business Communications and Ethics.&nbsp; In hindsight, it was very appropriate that this course be the very first course in the program.&nbsp; After an overview of communications and ethics, the course pressed two things very hard.</p>
<h2>Candor and differentiation</h2>
<p>Mr. Welch <a href="http://www.jwmi.com/content/business-communication-and-ethics-candor">contends</a> that “the biggest dirty little secret in business” is the absence of candor (Winning).&nbsp; The course teaches that so many problems rise out of the fear of honest communication.&nbsp; We are reminded that children are naturally candid and have no filter in what they say.&nbsp; It is through cultural conditioning that we learn to hold in what we are really thinking.&nbsp; In some organizations, the culture discourages real candor.&nbsp; Instead, saving face is valued more.</p>
<p>A key example of candor taught in this course relates to performance appraisals.&nbsp; Jack is famous for teaching a 20/70/10 differentiation method where management communicates to employees where they stand.&nbsp; This is most important for the bottom 10%.&nbsp; He contends that it is unfair to the employee to keep that honest feedback from those employees, who may spend more years at the company not understanding why they are not progressing in their careers.&nbsp; Instead, Jack contends that being candid with these employees, and helping them leave, is much more fair to them.&nbsp; The central idea in this is the belief that everyone is a star at the right company and the faster they realize the current company isn’t tapping their unique strengths, the sooner they can find the company and role that helps them shine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This method of candid performance communication drives a lot of controversy, but usually not from the top 20%.&nbsp; After this course, we slowly implemented this method at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a>, and I have to attest that it works.&nbsp; We do quarterly performance reviews, and we differentiate.&nbsp; Through some conference call questions with Mr. Welch during the program, students were able to ask him questions, and he clarified his method for smaller companies where the law of large numbers doesn’t yield a good 20/70/10 distribution.&nbsp; He said that the benefit is there as long as there is real differentiation.&nbsp; He coaches that management must be honest with itself and realize that not all employees are the same.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Ethics and managing a crisis</h2>
<p>After some academic reading on case studies involving corporate ethics, we were able to discuss a timely scandal.&nbsp; That was the scandal of BP and the communication method used after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP at the time, failed to get out ahead of the crisis.&nbsp; When a crisis happens, the curriculum teaches that leaders need to get out ahead of crisis communication and be the source of new information.&nbsp; Tony Hayward failed to do this.&nbsp; Because of it, news media filled the role of finding and communicating new pieces of information.&nbsp; When the news is coming from reporters, the revelations allude to a cover-up, where there is one or not.&nbsp; As a leader, claiming the role of briefer positions one as transparent.&nbsp; Regardless of mistakes made in a crisis, a worse mistake is not owning and leading crisis resolution.</p>
<p>You can read one of the <a href="http://www.jwmi.com/content/business-communication-and-ethics-candor">lectures of this course here</a>.</p>

			Headspring Out on the Town</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We often think of bonding and rapport as something done with clients, but it’s just as valuable with your colleagues.  At Headspring, we believe it’s important to celebrate our successes and reenergize by bonding as a team.  We do this daily through teamwork, but every once in a while we simply need to have some fun together.  For our Q3 get together, we teamed up with City Sleuth, an expert city scavenger hunt company, to enjoy an afternoon of solving riddles and scavenging around downtown.  We sure got to know Austin really well!  In the end, we honored team members with awards, ate a great lunch, and created memories outside of the office environment.</p>
