			Why Should I Use HTML5&#8217;s New Elements?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question I’m frequently asked typically goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I hear about all these new HTML tags, but I don’t have any problem with using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s like I&#8217;ve always done. Why should I care?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The questioners are referring to the new elements introduced with HTML5, including <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> (which encapsulates a part of your page containing navigation elements), <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> (think of a newspaper story, with its heading, byline, callouts, etc.), and <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/new-structural-elements-in-html5/">among others</a>. While it&#8217;s true the Web survived for many years without these new elements, there&#8217;s no reason to stand on tradition. The new elements provide a number of benefits to both Web developers and end users, and, best of all, you can start using them right away!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content aggregators and search providers can better figure out your content.</strong> News aggregators and search engines are everywhere, and are often an excellent way to disseminate your published content. Why not make it easy on them by explicitly marking what parts of your page they care about and what parts they can ignore?</li>
<li><strong>Screen readers need all the help they can get.</strong> Many potential visitors require assistive devices to view the Web, but Web sites have been slow to adopt tools to help. HTML5’s new elements help out by letting screen readers know what sections of the page represent real content, and what sections are simply visual fluff.</li>
<li><strong>The new tags are there, regardless.</strong> Either natively or with easy and clever workarounds, practically all browsers in use today recognize the new elements. Plus, they&#8217;ve been standardized by a number of industry groups. It&#8217;s never been easier to simply start working with them and you can rest easy knowing the new elements are here to stay.</li>
<li><strong>Your coworkers will thank you.</strong> The new elements are far more descriptive than the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> standby is, meaning the same content is considerably more understandable to other developers looking at your HTML source. Self-explanatory semantic markup reduces confusion and is often cleaner-looking than its cousins with pervasive use of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags.</li>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re probably already using them.</strong> These elements were added to the HTML5 specification because Web designers were already using them&#8230;just in a more verbose format. Most Web sites have common sections, like a header, navigation, and footer, yet there was no way to signify this with HTML. Thanks to the new elements, instead of something like this (which used to be all over the Internet):
<pre>&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&#39;footer&#39;&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>&#8230;we now have a much more concise representation of the same concept:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>Much better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re working on a Web site for the newest, hottest start-up or helping maintain a 10-year-old internal Web site, the new HTML5 elements can provide you with a number of benefits. They&#8217;re easy to start using, respected by Web developers and search engines alike, and, soon, you’ll start to wonder how you lived without them.</p>
<p>Have you encountered other benefits of using the new HTML5 elements? Have a particularly-elegant use case for one? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			Leadership Characteristics for a Strong Team</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/?attachment_id=3488" rel="attachment wp-att-3488"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3488" title="Leader and his team" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/leadership-characteristics.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="346" /></a>From championship-winning sports teams to multi-million dollar companies, strong, cohesive and successful teams take a great amount of hard work, dedication and focus. While many successful teams and organizations credit the strength of the team effort as the reason for their success, there is no doubt great leaders also have a big impact and are a big part of the foundation for a strong team. Think about how Vince Lombardi’s coaching in the NFL or Walt Disney’s inspiration in the entertainment industry left impacting legacies and provided great guidance to their teams. Without leaders like Lombardi and Disney, the success of the Green Bay Packers and the Disney franchise would be different in the history books. Behind great companies, organizations, and teams are instrumental individuals with key leadership characteristics who can propel the results from good to great.</p>
<p>Great leaders take on a mission or goal of an organization or as entrepreneurs do, they develop one of their own. They live the mission, which many times comes from their passion of doing what they love. Clear illustrations are athletes who love the game and encourage their teammates by example on the field. Another example is Steve Jobs and his love of improving technology for people. Their passion bleeds into their actions and inevitably shows in the results.</p>
<p>Great leaders then strategize the best ways to reach their goal and guide their team on the route, which may even involve shifting the route when obstacles arise, new teammates are recruited or unavoidable circumstances come their way. Great leaders not only adapt to change but they excel through it. The risks they take may not always have the best outcomes, but they learn from their experiences to make better choices in the future.</p>
<p>Although many may argue that great leaders are born, there are clear examples in history and even at Headspring, that great leaders can be made. With changing needs in the environment, such as new problems that need solutions, a leader can be made when he/she encounters circumstances. In those situations, self-made or environment-made, a great leader excels when he/she is able to take his/her focus on the goal and guide the rest of the team to achieve the goal. Great leaders stay engaged with their team and encourage and challenge them along the way. It’s important for leaders to stay focused, accept and adapt to change when necessary and support their team the best they can.</p>
<p>Do you know any great leaders? What do you admire most about him/her?</p>

			Client Retention: Get New, Keep Existing</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Custom software projects are hard. The Standish Group reported in 2009 that only 33% of software projects are successful! Ouch. There are many strategies to ensure successful delivery of custom software projects. One is strongly related to the relationship between the provider and the client and how the parties work together to respond when a problem arises. How this response is handled sets the tone for either a long-term healthy relationship or a one-time customer. A strong, positive response leads to client retention.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago, Headspring made a radically unique decision that in retrospect, unlocked our future growth.  We focused all of our efforts on <strong>keeping every single client</strong> that we get. In order to achieve this, it was imperative for us to start by doing the following two things:</p>
<p>1)      Find a good culture fit between our clients and us. This gives the relationship a head start and helps us be better aligned with the client’s need and goals</p>
<p>2)      Ensure our client’s needs are mapped directly to our core competencies so we are in a position to add the maximum amount of value possible.</p>
<p>We called this the “Get New, Keep Existing” strategy.  It sounds simple, but it is alarming how many companies have trouble with this and never realize that this is the key to their future growth.</p>
<p>Working only with clients to whom you can bring value is important.  It is our sales team’s responsibility to seek other companies that will gain value from our core competencies and that will be a strong culture fit for us and our core values – like honest communication and drive for excellence.  By finding clients who gain value from your core competencies, it will lead to a more transparent exchange.  Bottom line is that we must be a good fit for <strong>each other</strong>.</p>
<p>Our goal at Headspring is to pioneer the “no surprises” movement in the custom software industry. Strong communication and a win/win attitude will keep both parties from unreasonably high or incorrect expectations.  There is no sense in pushing a product or a service on a client when it doesn’t fit their needs.</p>
<p>Once the fit is established, and the work has begun, good account management is one strategy that mitigates the risk of a project failing, and increases the chance that the client will return for more services.  It establishes a strong relationship that gives clients a greater level of comfort in sharing candid feedback.  In addition, it provides a strong foundation to solve tough problems that will arise with any custom software project. I have mapped out a few techniques, like the Rule of Three, in my <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/account-management-taking-off-the-rosecolored-glasses">previous blog</a>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and we have seen dramatic growth, attributing a great deal of our progress to the simple “Get New, Keep Existing” approach.</p>
<p>What if you focused all of your resources and people on getting the right clients, and keeping the ones you have?</p>

			Hey TFS, Git Out of My Way!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For about half a year, I&#8217;ve been using git for personal projects.  My use case, though, has been atypical and simplistic: a single user committing locally, treating GitHub as little more than a backup.  It suited my needs to date, and at least it exposed me to a few of the advantages of git over subversion, but I knew I was missing out on a lot of the power available.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m working on a project that uses TFS for source control.  We are <del>mitigating</del> supplementing TFS with <a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs">git-tfs</a>, a tool that allows you to work with git locally and then push your finished feature branches up to TFS.  Again, that&#8217;s a little atypical and a little limited compared to a git-only project, but it&#8217;s exposed me to a lot more of the concepts and commands that I have been missing out on.</p>
<p>TFS is completely ignorant of the fact that I&#8217;m using git.  My local git repository starts out as a copy of the entire history of the TFS trunk, and I&#8217;m free to create local feature branches off of that.  I commit as much as I want to a local feature branch, and then use a git-tfs command that batches all of my local commits up into one TFS commit, complete with the TFS commit dialog.  I can avoid TFS-style merging, instead using git commands and my favorite merge tool to incorporate upstream changes into my local copy.  Jimmy Bogard has already described <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2011/09/20/git-workflows-with-git-tfs/">the git-tfs workflow</a> in detail.</p>
<p>Before this recent new project, my progress up the git learning curve was pointlessly slow.  Although there are a lot of good tutorials out there, it just wasn&#8217;t sinking in.  <strong>What made all the difference for me was to have an experienced git user sit down with me for about an hour, physically going through the motions of the workflow.</strong>  We started with the TFS clone, created and switched between branches, made some commits, submitted to TFS, and then pulled down upstream changes into our local repositories.  We set up two users to simultaneously modify the same files, and walked through a typical rebase.  All of a sudden, things started to sink in.  It&#8217;s just one of those things you have to <em>do</em> rather than <em>study</em>.</p>
<p>Along the way, we had the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/">Git Extensions</a> browser open at all times.  We&#8217;d refresh this after executing any interesting command.  It helped a lot to do so, especially when you get to the point where you can predict what the updated screen will look like in advance.  This is an exaggeration, but <strong>git is first and foremost a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a>-building tool, and only incidentally a source control tool</strong>, so seeing the graph build up with each command really helps you to unlearn the metaphors that your previous source control tool etched into your brain.</p>
<p>With that basic foundation, it&#8217;s now becoming easier to introduce myself to other commands.  If you want to put an extremely sharp tool in your tool belt, find a buddy, have a repository browser handy, and just dive in.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Steve Donie</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Steve-Donie.jpg"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Steve-Donie_thumb.jpg" alt="Steve Donie" width="164" height="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>When Steve Donie was hired as a Principal Consultant at Headspring in early 2011, he hit the ground running.  His first day on the job, he started as the project lead for EPA Systems, designing a system for tracking greenhouse gasses for a large oil and gas company.  He encompasses the solutions based approach that we covet so much at Headspring and in life.  At home, Steve and his father worked on a massive project digitizing hundreds of family photos from their original slides onto an online portal for their entire family to share.  He is also the webmaster for his local high school’s swim team. And when he is not plugging away on a computer, he can be designing and building furniture, or enjoying the company of his two brilliant daughters.</p>
<p>Basically, getting to know Steve meant getting to know how diverse his background truly is, and his desire to really involve himself in the world that surrounds him.  Here is some of what we talked about:</p>
<p><strong>What tools and technologies would you consider yourself an expert in?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been doing software development for over 20 years and have worked with a variety of different languages and technologies.  I’ve mostly worked in a Microsoft environment, starting with DOS, through Windows 3.1, through all the various intervening versions of Windows, up to the current Windows 7.  I’ve also done a fair amount of work on the GNU/Linux platform and on Mac OSX. Language-wise, I’ve mainly used C, C++, Java and C#.</p>
<p><strong>What work or studies have you done with these tools and technologies that make you feel expert in them?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve mainly worked in industry rather than in consulting.  My first job out of college was developing a screen reader for Windows 95, so I had to learn a lot about accessibility.  I then worked for Microsoft in their Accessibility and Disabilities group.  My next ‘career’ had me working for a company developing sub-surface modeling and simulation software for the oil and gas industry.  I then focused on improving my test-driven design skills and learning C# and .NET on a project handling law firm invoices.  I took another turn through the oil and gas business, honing my leadership, management, and project management skills before coming to Headspring in March 2011.</p>
<p><strong>What would you say that your team relies on you for?</strong></p>
<p>Probably my domain expertise.  Windows internals, accessibility for people with disabilities, and a lot of work for the oil and gas industry are all included.  I also have a particular passion for agile software development processes, and automating the software development lifecycle, from builds through deploys.  I have also been told that I am great at explaining things; I try to be the translator between technical and non-technical folks.</p>
<p><strong>When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></p>
<p>My first memory was that I wanted to be an architect. I watched a lot of “Brady Bunch” and thought Mike Brady was pretty cool.  Later on, I decided I wanted to be a fighter pilot, and went to the United States Air Force Academy in pursuit of that goal.  I soon learned that “Maverick” from Top Gun was not how pilots really were, and transferred to the University of Texas to pursue my second love - computers.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I am very motivated by successful results.  If something that took a lot of time does not turn out how I wanted it to, it’s harder for me to just say “oh well; I learned something.”  However, during a project, I am patient and careful based on the successful results that I am expecting.</p>
<p><strong>What do you listen to on your way to work?</strong></p>
<p>I mainly listen to the news on NPR when I drive, and podcasts when I walk my dog.  I listen to a few technical podcasts (This Developer’s life, dotNet Rocks, Software Engineering Radio) and other podcasts (RadioLab, This American Life, Planet Money) when I walk my dog.  When I listen to music I lean towards classic rock (Beatles, Stones, The Who, Grateful Dead), Reggae, and alternative/punk.</p>
