			How to Integrate With Other Systems Reliably</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A couple of years ago, I started working with a client on a system that worked as an integration point and decision engine for a large, nationwide brick-and-mortar store that was just beginning to introduce a customer loyalty program (think like Best Buy Rewards).</p>
<p>The system built was like the ones I’ve always built, with the caveat that there was very little in terms of a user interface. Instead, customers never interacted directly with the application, and we received notices of external events (and then notified others) through a variety of integration patterns, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing flat files</li>
<li>Consuming flat files (CSV, XML etc.)</li>
<li>Consuming 3rd party webservices</li>
<li>Exposing web services to 3rd parties</li>
</ul>
<p>This system had to consume a lot of information that it didn’t originate, and there was a lot of potential for failures all up and down the line. Just about everything in the system was done synchronously, and not much could easily (if at all) recover from any kinds of failures or downtime.</p>
<p>We had files we would process that would sometimes get halfway through, something would mess up, and we’d have to process the file over again. But what about all those records we already processed? Even if we had ways to figure out what was processed and what wasn’t, we would have to re-process a million lines in the file before finding the record  that was the next one to process.</p>
<h3>Dealing with failures</h3>
<p>One of the critical files we received were customers that went into the stores to sign up for the loyalty program. Customers would provide their email address, the stores would collect them, and hand them to our system for processing. We would take the emails, make sure that there weren’t already anyone associated with that email address, and send the member an email.</p>
<p>It was a lot more complicated than that, and currently we communicate with two separate customer management systems through a dozen or so web service calls to fully enter a new member into the system. What became complicated was that each of these processors was essentially a giant “foreach” loop, chugging through the file and doing things. But what would happen if the web services went down? Or the server restarted? Or we needed to deploy the system?</p>
<p>We would have to wait until all these critical processes were done to deploy. If it was interrupted, we often dropped files, and no matter how much proactive saving we did, we always lost records. You know that guy that hits “Save” in Microsoft Office obsessively? That’s what we tried to do.</p>
<h3>Coupling, coupling everywhere</h3>
<p>Eventually, our system came to make many critical decisions throughout processing. For example, new enrollees, if it was close to your birthday, would receive a birthday reward. Issuing rewards could get complicated, however, since we needed to make sure that what we generated satisfied all the guidelines for the POS systems (unique coupons/barcodes, etc.).</p>
<p>However, the act of issuing a reward to someone during registration was fairly rare, but also fairly expensive. We have to do work to make sure we don’t double-issue and the like. But because we didn’t really have a way to signal that “a reward needed to be issued”, and not slow down the registration processing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we wanted separate the event of “CustomerRegistered” with the side effect of “IssueBirthdayReward”. But without some sort of messaging, we had to have it all-in-one. And all that coupling just made it hard for the system to evolve.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Towards messaging</h3>
<p>Because of the brittleness of our current architecture, we decided to go towards a message-oriented approach. Why is that? For one, we were already processing what were effectively messages. Each line in the files, each web service call received already was a message. However, our existing approach was to try and process them all at once, synchronously.</p>
<p>It was fairly straightforward to imagine this system using asynchronous, durable messages for doing what we were doing in the “foreach” loop, but the question became “which technology?”. I had used MSMQ in the past, but it was EXTEREMELY painful to try and use that API directly. Even looking at other queuing technologies, I didn’t want to build a system directly on top of a queue system. Queuing systems often don’t talk about messages in terms of C# classes and the like, and products like NServiceBus and Mass Transit made it ridiculously easy to send and receive messages over a queue.</p>
<p>So where are we now? Currently, I have a system with around 20 different NServiceBus endpoints, about 10 or so separate sagas, performing operations like waking up to retrieve files from an FTP to writing files to calling web services to bulk import and export operations. It was a long journey, but we’ve seen incidences of failures drastically decrease as we brought processing into messaging. How much better? That registration file, from customer stores, had been dropping about a file a day since the program’s inception, to a total of about 500 files.</p>
<p>When we moved to messaging, not a single file has ever been skipped.</p>
<p>See how easy it is to get started with NServiceBus, check out my <a href="http://www.headspring.com/resources/videos/" target="_blank">quickstart video</a> that takes you through the steps.</p>

			Onion Architecture: Part 4 - After Four Years</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In 2008, I coined a new pattern name called Onion Architecture.  You can read the previous parts here: <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-2/">part 2</a>, <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-3/">part 3</a>.  Over these four years, I’ve spoken about this pattern at user groups, conferences, and it’s even published in one of the chapters of <a href="http://manning.com/palermo3">ASP.NET MVC in Action</a> from <a href="http://manning.com/palermo3">Manning</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been overwhelmed by the traction this pattern name has enjoyed.  Folks from all over the country have written about and have talked about the pattern.  Some of the ones I’ve noticed are here (please comment with more – I welcome it).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ayende.com/blog/3464/onion-architecture">Ayende Rahien’s opinion on Onion Architecture</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cunningclinton.com/post/2011/07/19/Onion-Architecture.aspx">“Cunning” Clinton’s view</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.tonysneed.com/2011/10/08/peeling-back-the-onion-architecture/">Tony Sneed’s view and code sample</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/onion-architecture">StackOverflow questions on Onion Architecture</a></li>
<li><a href="http://chicagoalt.net/event/july-2011-meeting-onion-architecture-with-asp-net-mvc">Matt Hidinger’s Chicago .Net User Group video presentation on OA</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9732747/what-type-of-architecture-is-this-called/9933371#9933371">One interesting StackOverflow question.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in 2008, I defined four tenets of Onion Architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The application is built around an independent object model</em></li>
<li><em>Inner layers define interfaces.  Outer layers implement interfaces</em></li>
<li><em>Direction of coupling is toward the center</em></li>
<li><em>All application core code can be compiled and run separate from infrastructure</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there has been significant adoption of this pattern, I have received countless questions about how to implement it in various environments.  I mostly get asked about how it relates to domain-driven design.  First, onion architecture works well with and without DDD patterns.  It works well with CQRS, forms over data, and DDD.  It is merely an architectural pattern where the core object model is represented in a way that does not accept dependencies on less stable code.</p>
<p><a href="http://codecampserver.codeplex.com/">CodeCampServer</a> was an original sample of onion architecture, but it also grew as a sample of how to do ASP.NET MVC in various ways, how to use Portable Areas, and how to use <a href="http://mvccontrib.org">MvcContrib</a> features like input builders.  If you are just looking for onion architecture, it has too much going on.  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jeffreypalermo/onion-architecture">I have pushed a much simpler solution</a> that represents onion architecture concepts.  I have intentionally not included a UI input form or an IoC container, which most people associate with onion architecture.  Onion architecture works just fine without the likes of StructureMap or Castle Windsor.  Please check out the code here and let me know if this presents a simple approach – that is the goal.</p>
<p>When there is enough interest, I will continue this series with more parts.  CQRS definitely deserves some addressing within this architecture, and so do object models that support task-based UIs.</p>

			What Is Technology?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/what-is-technology/frustrating-printer" rel="attachment wp-att-4418"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4418" title="frustrating printer" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/frustrating-printer.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="271" /></a>I have never met a printer I liked. They break all the time, they are buggy and noisy, and cartridges are way too expensive.</p>
<p>Printers are a terrible bane on my existence, and I have made a purpose to rid myself of needing them at all. I have come to realize that I am not alone in this grievance, and going on without the need for a frustrating printer is no longer a difficult task. Google Docs, EchoSign and a whole host of other cloud-based offerings have significantly reduced our reliance on printers, and they have added years back to my life.</p>
<p>But this post isn’t <em>all</em> about how much I hate printers – it’s old news. I work for a technology company, and technology is about new news.</p>
<p>This morning I heard about an exciting new branch of technology: 3D printing. It works - unlike regular printing - and instead of making a document, it makes an object. Recently a doctor in Belgium has worked with 3D printing to create a new jaw for an elderly patient. The jaw was literally molded together with a laser printer that heats small particles of titanium in layers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/what-is-technology/jaw-made-with-printer" rel="attachment wp-att-4419"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4419" title="jaw made with printer" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jaw-made-with-printer-300x167.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>As I mentioned, cloud computing has changed the paper printing business as we know it, but some printing companies are willing to accept this new opportunity as a challenge to reinvent. The exciting technology in this story is not the artificial jaw. The technology is in using a 3D printer to make it.</p>
<p>The printing business is moving away from ink and paper to useable 3D objects, but they have the same message and mission: convenience. They are saving people from painful procedures which harvest bone and tissue from other parts of their body, and they are changing the landscape of artificial implant offerings to the medical community. Also, printing implants could be much cheaper than harvesting or manufacturing them. <em>That</em> is technology!</p>
<p>My point is, when it’s time to improve technology in business, or put technology in the classroom, or bring technology to nursing homes, we may not have to look very far. Overhead projectors and pocket calculators were once considered expensive technology. Be brave enough to look at what you have available. You don’t have to mask your problems with a new device. Why throw an iPad into the equation if it isn’t necessary? Instead, open yourself up to change. Look around and create technology first with people and processes.</p>
<p>So how tech savvy are you? What are some other examples of reinvented technology?</p>

			What Is Hg Rebase?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A couple weeks ago I introduced a client developer I&#8217;m working with on a project to <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension">Hg Rebase</a> because the work we were doing at the time didn&#8217;t really need feature branches of any kind. When I was asked how this works over the phone, I explained it the best I could on the spot, but here&#8217;s a better attempt.</p>
<h3><strong>Rebase vs Merge</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of adding several changesets and committing them on top as a &#8220;merge&#8221; commit, Rebase uses graft (essentially a cherry-pick in the git world). My typical workflow includes taking an entirely new branch and place it &#8220;on top&#8221; of another branch. After this is done, it looks more like a straight line instead of something that has been braided. As you can see by the three diagrams below. A rebase removes the unnecessary merge commit and gives you a cleaner history. This tends to be easier for people to follow and understand than the messes you can end up with after loads of merge commits all over the place.</p>
<p>[gallery link=&#8221;file&#8221; order=&#8221;DESC&#8221;]</p>
<p>For a more detailed look into Rebase, visit <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebasePlan">the official Mercurial site</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in looking at the extension&#8217;s code, it can be found on BitBucket at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/astratto/rebase-soc/">https://bitbucket.org/astratto/rebase-soc/</a>. I&#8217;m glad I was asked the question about how rebase works. Learning the internal details was really helpful for me and hopefully for you too!</p>

			You Want to Change What?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Change is inevitable. It is a simple fact of life which permeates into just about everything. Software development is no exception. Many software development life cycles have evolved and others have come into existence in an effort to help us deal with change. Programming languages, tools and techniques are also continuously evolving as well. Yet with all these improvements many project teams continue to struggle with change.</p>
<p>What can we do about change? The truth is change doesn’t have to be hard. There are many things we can do such as plan for change, design for change, and code for change.</p>
<p>Sounds great doesn’t it? There are actually dozens of books and a plethora of blog posts that talk about those principles.</p>
<p>If you are still reading this, then you are probably wondering how to put those principles into practice. I will share a practical example with you.</p>
<p>A short while ago, I blogged <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/i-have-frameworkcommitment-issues">about selecting a framework</a>. The premise was a real situation in which a company I was consulting for selected a framework, changed their mind, and then changed it back. The actual frameworks involved are not important. The important thing is that the change was essentially painless.</p>
<p>Here is how pain was avoided.</p>
<p>I worked on a subsystem with very well defined boundaries of responsibility. One thing the subsystem had to do was to send a message to another subsystem. That was easy enough.</p>
<p>I started working on the core domain logic of the subsystem and I reached the point where a domain object implemented the business logic that decided to send a message to the other subsystem. The details of the message format and content were still fuzzy and that was a clear indicator that change was coming. Anticipating change here, I decided to use an interface to allow me to continue developing the business logic while the details of the messages were in limbo.</p>
<p>My code looked something like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1979430.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>I used unit tests to make sure the business logic was sound and leveraged a mocking framework to mock the message publisher. Shortly thereafter a decision was made to implement a third party message bus to handle some of the messaging details. Again this was easy enough to do. We just implemented the IMessagePublisher interface.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1979561.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>I ended up using a dependency injection framework to inject a MessagePublisher instance into the BusinessObject during runtime. We were also able to use a combination of unit tests and integration tests to make sure the third party message bus worked correctly. The key thing to take away here is that this MessagePublisher class and a couple of supporting classes (omitted from the code sample) were the only places where the third party code touched our subsystem.</p>
<p>When the client decided to change to another third party message bus, we only had to change one class.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1979613.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Honestly, it was a little more involved. There were a couple of other classes involved that handled the set up and configuration of the third party message bus. But the net effect of the change was limited to about three small classes, a few unit tests, and a few integration tests.</p>
<p>When the client decided to change back to the original third party message bus, I just recovered the previous implementation, unit tests, and integration tests from source control.</p>
<p>It was pretty much painless.</p>
<p>Granted not all changes are this easy. But when we plan, design, and code with change in mind we end up in a position where we can respond to change.</p>

			Publishing a Simple NuGet Package</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://nuget.org/">NuGet</a> is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to pull third-party libraries into your projects.  It can also bring in their dependencies, along the same lines as gems for Ruby development.</p>
<p>I recently <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/migrating-from-bitbucket-to-github">migrated Headspring&#8217;s Enumeration class to GitHub</a>.  This is a simple class that, for the most part, replaces the need for .NET enum types.  One of the simplest things a NuGet package can do is add a file to your project, so creating and publishing an updated NuGet package for Enumeration was a great way to get my feet wet.</p>
<p>Unlike most things, it was as easy as it should be.</p>
<p>First, I created an account on <a href="http://nuget.org">nuget.org</a> and installed the extension using the link on the front page.  Next, I downloaded the <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/releases/view/58939">NuGet.exe command-line tool</a> and made sure it was included in my PATH.  On my account profile page, I&#8217;m given the chance to see my API Key.  Keep this secret.  At the command line, we need to issue a one-time command so that this key can be active during subsequent nuget commands:</p>
<p><code>$ nuget setApiKey 123-abc-123-abc-123</code></p>
<p>You create a *.nuspec file which describes the files you want to publish.  Then you ask nuget.exe to turn that file into a *.nupkg file.  A nupkg file is actually a zip file containing the files to be deployed as well as some metadata.</p>
<p>At this point, the project consisted of 3 files: a README, LICENSE.txt, and Enumeration.cs.  While in this folder, I issued a command to create a skeleton of a nuspec file:</p>
<p><code>$ nuget spec</code></p>
<p>This creates Package.nuspec, which I renamed to Enumeration.nuspec and populated:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2155348.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t much going on here.  We say what version number we want to publish, a few descriptive fields, and then list the files we want to be included in the nupkg &#8216;zip&#8217; file.  In the file tags, <code>src</code> refers to the files relative to the location of the nuspec file, and <code>target</code> describes the path we want to copy it to <em>within</em> the zip.  Starting these paths with &#8220;content&#8221; means that when someone installs the package into one of their own projects, the files will be copied and then added to the target project file.</p>
<p>To publish, we just need to issue the following commands:</p>
<p><code>$ nuget pack Enumeration.nuspec</code><br />
<code>$ nuget push Enumeration.1.0.4.nupkg</code><br />
<code>$ del Enumeration.1.0.4.nupkg</code></p>
<p><code>nuget pack</code> converts a nuspec into a nupkg, and <code>nuget push</code> submits it to <a href="http://nuget.org/">nuget.org</a>.  After that, we don&#8217;t need to keep a copy of the nupgk, so we delete it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it!  Next week, we&#8217;ll cover the slightly more involved scenario of publishing a whole open-source library.</p>

			Headspring Values: What Matters Most?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/headspring-values-what-matters-most/sharon-and-jt" rel="attachment wp-att-4229"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4229" title="sharon and jt" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/sharon-and-jt-229x300.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/headspring-values-what-matters-most/kevin-award" rel="attachment wp-att-4230"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4230" title="kevin award" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/kevin-award-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I come from a long list of companies that “talk the talk” about how valuable their employees are.  It comes from a good place, and it’s rarely insincere.  In my opinion, and you may disagree, most people are good people – even your boss and your boss’s boss.</p>
<p>However, “walking the walk” is extremely difficult, and my experience of the corporate world has shown me the implementation of all those good intentions usually turns out a little lack luster.  Treating everyone equally, rewarding good service, or fostering an open environment for communication is all fine and good when sales are up, negativity is down and there are only great things to say.  But there is often a huge disconnect between what a company <em>tells</em> their employees is encouraged, and what they show them when the going gets tough.</p>
<p>Ever worked somewhere with an “Open Door” policy? Unofficially interprets itself as the “Open Door, but not, y’know, <em>That</em> Door” policy.</p>
<p>At previous jobs, I’ve been barked at, I’ve been told “my place”, and I’ve been scolded for trying to do more good the wrong way.  I am not alone in those experiences. Most people at most companies have dealt with these issues at some point.  All the Employee of the Month awards in the world can’t take away the sting of a reactionary reprimand.</p>
<p>And then there was Headspring.</p>
<p>Working at Headspring is a breath of honest to goodness fresh air.  Everything I ever believed about how a company should treat people - employees and customers alike - is right here in this space.</p>
<p>Headspring has a really interesting take on keeping the culture in check.  First of all, and like most companies, we have Core Values:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive for Excellence</li>
<li>People are Valued</li>
<li>Honest Communication</li>
<li>Passion for Learning and Growth</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These four values are the driving force behind every decision we make – top down, bottom up, etc.  If we have a policy, you can bet there has been a long, companywide discussion about how it touches each value.  Same goes for internal processes and procedures.  If anything conflicts with one of the values, we put it to test and revisit the drawing board. The values never change, and never will.  Everything revolves around them.</p>
<p>This is hard.  Is your boss prepared to open up all the financial statements of the company to every employee – including cash on hand – every month? Mine is. Is your boss prepared to lead an open discussion on what we want in a new office space or where it should be? Mine is. Is your boss ready to show you the hiring pipeline of candidates on a display big enough for the whole company to see? You guessed it; mine is. Just like our tagline, <strong>No Surprises</strong>.</p>
<p>Another way we keep the values in the forefront is through our Headspring Values Awards.  Each month, we email our Office Manager and People Are Valued Award Recipient, Rebecca Heath, with nominations for fellow teammates that have displayed these values in their everyday work.  The nominations are usually long and descriptive, sometimes emotional, and sometimes funny.  Nominations never expire, and there is no limit on the number that can be submitted per person.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;">When it’s time for our Monthly All Hands Meeting, Rebecca types up and distributes all the nominations.  The leadership team awards two a month, with a plaque, speech, and a handshake.  It’s worth mentioning that we get to read all the nominations, which is nearly as good as getting selected for an award.</span></p>
<p>“Yeah, only two were picked, but Alonso appreciated my work on our project, and wrote it down. I had feared maybe I was irritating him, but he appreciated that I challenged his ideas! I know this because the awards process is as open as anything else” – Sharon Cichelli, recent nominee</p>
<p>What’s important about this to me is that we nominate each other.  We decide.  We share.  Together, we keep the values from becoming cute or meaningless.  They are real and relevant every day.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;">Keeping the company in check is hard to do, but it helps to put your money where your mouth is.  We believe there is a better way to do business, to build software, and to run a company.</span></p>
<p>How does your company show you that you are valued?</p>

			How Not to Say &#8220;Um&#8221; When Presenting</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ll start with the tip, then unpack the reason why it works and explain how to apply it. To avoid those hemming and hawing filler words—um, y&#8217;know, like—and give your presentations the polish of eloquence:</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 3em; font-size: 1.5em;"><p>Make eye contact.</p></blockquote>
<h2>An Excursion into Psycholinguistics</h2>
<p>To avoid filler words, it helps to understand why we say them, which falls under the domain of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics">psycholinguistics</a>.</p>
<p>When you and I are having a conversation, we take turns speaking, and we use a variety of verbal and non-verbal cues to signal when to switch. I&#8217;ll ask a question and then pause, and you instinctively know that it is your turn to talk. While you&#8217;re telling a story, you&#8217;ll pause periodically to see if I am following, and I will make an encouraging sound (&#8220;mm hm&#8221; or &#8220;go on&#8221;) to confirm that it is still your turn. You might say something that sparks an idea in me that I very much want to share, and the changes in my facial expression—bright eyes and an intake in breath—convey my request to have a turn. If I get these cues wrong and repeatedly speak during what you consider <em>your turn</em>, you will think I&#8217;m rude and interrupty.</p>
<p>Note that most of those transitions were signaled by a pause. To avoid being interrupted, when you need a moment to organize your thoughts but are not ready to relinquish your turn, you&#8217;ll phonate (fancy linguist term for &#8220;make noise with your speech apparatus&#8221;). You don&#8217;t have any words to say, but you want to fill the silence to retain your hold on the conversation, so you&#8217;ll use meaningless words. You&#8217;ll say &#8220;um.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Maintaining Your Turn While Presenting</h2>
<p>Consider how turn negotiation changes when you are presenting in front of an audience. Your instincts tell you that a pause will cause you to lose your turn, but in reality, you&#8217;re on stage. It&#8217;s your show. We in the audience have granted you an extended turn. You would feel uncomfortable in a one-on-one conversation talking for 20 minutes without exchanging turns, but it is normal, expected, and exactly appropriate during a presentation.</p>
<p>How do you override the unconscious desire to say &#8220;um&#8221; to maintain your turn? You make eye contact with your audience members. Deliberate, focused eye contact. Avoid scattershot scans over their heads or a fixated stare at the clock on the back wall. Instead, look at the members of your audience. Deliver a clause or a whole sentence to one person, then connect with another person for the next. Two beneficial side-effects are better reception from your audience and improved pacing in your delivery. Deliberate pauses become built in as you deliver points to different individuals.</p>
<p>When you make eye contact, your unconscious mind gets direct evidence that it is still your turn. You can see that there are no bids from the audience. You can feel the audience&#8217;s attention. That need to fill pauses with noise melts away.</p>

			Getting Started With RavenDB</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have been following the NoSQL movement for a while now. I have <a href="http://alonsorobles.com/2012/01/10/nosql-big-data-polyglot-persistence-a-new-era/">blogged about the movement</a> and even written a how to post on <a href="http://alonsorobles.com/2011/08/08/running-apache-cassandra-0-8-2-on-windows-7/">setting up a popular column oriented data store</a>. It’s exciting to see the development of so many persistence alternatives. Don’t get me wrong either. The RDBMS is not dead. It just no longer the only kid on the block.</p>
<p>Document databases are another persistence alternative to the traditional RDBMS and there are plenty to chose from (like <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">SimpleDB</a>, <a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a>,  and <a href="http://wiki.basho.com/Riak.html">Riak</a> to name a few). This post is intended to help get you started using RavenDB.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Installing RavenDB</span></h3>
<p>There are <a href="http://ravendb.net/download">a few different options for obtaining RavenDB</a>. When it’s available, I prefer using <a href="http://nuget.org/">Nuget</a> via the package manager console. So that’s how we are going to do it… Here we go.</p>
<p>I am assuming you already have a Visual Studio solution with some projects in it. I have a class library project targeting the .NET 4.0 framework called Persistence where all of my persistence logic goes. Using the package manager console, I install the RavenDB package.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1987578.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>From the output you can see a number of dependencies were installed. Feel free to hit your easy button now.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting the Server</span></h3>
<p>The next thing we need to do is to start up the server. Please note that these steps are here to get you started, not the steps you should follow for production use. I’ll throw in some other pointers along the way.</p>
<p>To start the server, open up windows explorer and navigate to your solution directory. You should find a packages directory there which was created by Nuget.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-32" rel="attachment wp-att-3954"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3954" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image.png" alt="" width="440" height="232" /></a></p>
<p>Navigate into the packages directory, then into the RavenDB directory, then into the server directory and locate the Raven.Server.exe file.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-33" rel="attachment wp-att-3956"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3956" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image1.png" alt="" width="440" height="232" /></a></p>
<p>Double click the Raven.Server.exe file to start the server. This will start a console window that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-34" rel="attachment wp-att-3958"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3958" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image2.png" alt="" width="440" height="232" /></a></p>
<p>Feel free to hit that easy button again!</p>
<p>The server has automatically created a data directory and started an HTTP server on port 8080. These settings can be changed in the Raven.Server.exe.config file as needed. Let’s move on.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Basics</span></h3>
<p>Before we start fiddling with data, we need to understand the basic mechanics of a document database. The concepts are pretty easy, but can be a mental leap if you spent years working with traditional relational databases. Here are the basic concepts from the top down.</p>
<p><strong>Database </strong>– The server is made up of database instances. Each database is made up of document collections. I like to think of a database like a filing cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>Collection</strong> – The instance is made up of collections which are nothing more than logical grouping of documents. I like to think of them as a folder or a bin that contain related documents.</p>
<p><strong>Document</strong> – A document is a single unit of data. It is made up of fields. Think about an email. It is a document which contains a single sender, one or more recipients, a subject, a timestamp, and a body. It is important to note that every document does not necessarily contain all the fields. That means there is no enforced schema for the documents. It may be helpful to think about a handwritten letter. A letter will most likely contain a recipient, a body, and a sender. But you could optionally add a return address, a subject line, a post script message, and/or a date.</p>
<p><strong>Field</strong> – A field is a key value pair. The key describes the contents of the field. The value maybe an array or a scalar value. It could also be a document or an array of documents. They are pretty flexible.</p>
<p>If you are still having a hard time wrapping your mind around these concepts, then you may find it useful to conceptually map these terms to relational data terms. Just remember that these mappings are not literally identical, they are somewhat similar concepts. I have also added a real world equivalent for comparison.</p>
<table width="374" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="195"><strong>Document DB Concept/Term</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="177"><strong>Similar SQL Concept/Term</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="208">Database</td>
<td valign="top" width="183">Database</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="211">Collection</td>
<td valign="top" width="186">Table</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="211">Document</td>
<td valign="top" width="187">Row</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="210">Field</td>
<td valign="top" width="188">Column</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You may still not fully understand the difference and that’s okay. The differences will become more apparent as you play with document databases.</p>
<p>Let’s get some hands on experience now.</p>
<p>Fire up the management studio by using your favorite browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080 while the server is still running.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-35" rel="attachment wp-att-3960"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3960" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image3.png" alt="" width="440" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>By default, the RavenDB server has created a “Default” database instance and that is the instance the management studio has connected to. The first thing we are going to do is create a database instance that we will use for the remainder of this discussion.</p>
<p>Click on the “Database” link towards the top right of the studio.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-36" rel="attachment wp-att-3962"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3962" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image4.png" alt="" width="440" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>Next click on the “New Database” button.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-37" rel="attachment wp-att-3964"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3964" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image5.png" alt="" width="300" height="96" /></a></p>
<p>Enter “ShoppingCartDemo” for the database name and click the “OK” button. You may be prompted for credentials. Go ahead and enter them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-38" rel="attachment wp-att-3966"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3966" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image6.png" alt="" width="440" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>Click on the “ShoppingCartDemo” database. Notice the navigation bar changed from “Databases &gt; Default” to “Databases &gt; ShoppingCartDemo”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-39" rel="attachment wp-att-3968"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3968" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image7.png" alt="" width="440" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>Congrats! You now have a new database instance and the management studio is now working in its context.</p>
<p>We could have done the same thing with some code. It looks like this.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2176197.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Now we are ready to add some data.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating Documents</span></h3>
<p>First we need to define our classes. We can do that with some simple C# like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1988820.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Then the application can do something like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2176205.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>After that code is executed by the application you can see a few things in the RavenDB management studio.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the collections page which can be accessed by clicking the “Collections” tab at the top of the studio.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-33" rel="attachment wp-att-3956"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3956" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image8.png" alt="" width="440" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>Notice that RavenDB has created a “ShoppingCarts” collection for us. This collection is a logical grouping of the ShoppingCart documents. Now click on the pencil icon on the document.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-33" rel="attachment wp-att-3956"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3956" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image9.png" alt="" width="440" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>Notice that the document is just a JSON serialized representation of the created cart. There is some metadata that RavenDB keeps to help it serialize and deserialize the JSON documents to plain old CLR objects.</p>
<p>Now we can retrieve documents.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Retrieving Documents</span></h3>
<p>We can now retrieve the shopping cart.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2176209.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updating Documents</span></h3>
<p>After retrieving a document, you will probably want to persist changes to it. This easy pretty easy to do.</p>
<p>We can refactor the shopping cart class a little here. By changing the array of line items to a list of line items, we can now easily add items to the cart.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1989715.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Now our application can make changes like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2176221.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Take a look at the document data in the management studio</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-33" rel="attachment wp-att-3956"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3956" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image10.png" alt="" width="440" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>Notice that the change in the shopping cart class had no impact in this operation. This is one of the neat features of a document DB. Adding and changing fields is pretty easy without having to worry about migrating data most of the time. There are some caveats with this. But that is a topic for another discussion.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deleting Documents</span></h3>
<p>We can now add a delete a cart easily like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2176223.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Take another look at collections tab in the management studio:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/getting-started-with-ravendb/image-png-33" rel="attachment wp-att-3956"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3956" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image11.png" alt="" width="440" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the document is gone, but RavenDB remembers the ShoppingCarts collection.</p>
<p>We have looked at:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to install RavenDB using Nuget for development</li>
<li>How to start up the RavenDB server (again for development and tinkering)</li>
<li>How to access the management studio</li>
<li>How to create a database using code and the studio</li>
<li>How to perform simplistic CRUD operations (create, retrieve, update, and delete) using the RavenDB client.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is much more to discuss about Raven. Make sure you look at the <a href="http://ravendb.net/">official RavenDB site for more information</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thanks for the feedback. I removed the repository pattern from the examples as the implementation example was taking away from the intent of the post.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Alonso Robles</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/get-to-know-a-developer-alonso-robles/alonso-v1" rel="attachment wp-att-4177"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4177" title="Alonso v1" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Alonso-v1-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Alonso Robles is our newest Principal Consultant at Headspring, and has quickly become an office favorite.  He is very enthusiastic about working here, and even <a href="http://alonsorobles.com/2012/03/14/joining-headspring/">wrote a blog</a> the other day expressing this sentiment.  But the thing I’ve noticed about Alonso is that he is enthusiastic about everything – his family, his projects, his clients.  He’s a refreshingly happy addition, and great for conversation.  Here was how ours went this morning:</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. I think everyone is an expert in something they just don’t know it. We all have things that we are really good at and things we are really passionate about. It’s those things that we are both really good and really passionate about that we typically experts in. My passions and experiences are with programming and developing back end systems – specifically distributed system integration and data persistence.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a long life story that starts from my early childhood. I can sum it up by saying I kind of fell into it as a result of necessity and luck.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>One of my earliest childhood memories involving computers was figuring out how to hack the dictionary file so I could beat an educational spelling game my father purchased for me in grade school on an IBM PS/2. I still remember the look in his face when I showed him I could beat the game by typing in gibberish on the keyboard. I also remember working the Logo programming language at my elementary school and programming a text based game in BASIC on that old IBM PS/2.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! I actually tutored math and science in high school. I think that may have been the first time I was in a real role with teaching capacity. I really enjoy speaking at user groups and helping my peers learn when I can. I sometimes find myself considering going back to school and working on a PhD so I may work as a professor.</p>
<p><strong>Where do begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>It just depends on the resources available and what is to be learned. I am constantly reading academic journals and blogs about topics I am interested in. When time permits I will go to a conference or convention. If I need to find more depth, I will usually grab a book and/or look for a training course. My favorite way to learn is to pair up with a peer or mentor and get my hands dirty by pair programming or drawing on whiteboard. I find a ton of value in interacting with an expert. Learning about the things they consider and think about while also getting familiar with the subject is indispensible in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>What does your team rely on you for?</strong></p>
<p>Developers do more than just code. They find creative solutions to both technical and human challenges and then translate those solutions to well crafted code. It really is in many ways more of art than a science. They rely on me to help them when they get stuck. I know I rely on them when I get stuck.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I gauge it by how much quality time I can spend away from work, especially with my wife and kids. If I can go home feeling proud about my day’s accomplishments with a clean conscience, then I can go home without worrying about work and focus on what matters most to me. That is “work time” well spent.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the future?</strong></p>
<p>At this point in my life I am pretty focused on raising my kids and getting them ready for life beyond the school years. After that, I am not really sure. Perhaps, I will go back to school and get that PhD. Or maybe just work towards retirement so I can enjoy more time with my family. I think I would like to travel with my wife a bit after the kids leave the nest. But those plans are still very fuzzy.</p>
