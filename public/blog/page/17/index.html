			Memory Management</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes I get a reputation for having a good memory, but I actually don&#8217;t trust it at all.  When it comes to my short-term memory, I find that simple things slip my mind far too easily if I don&#8217;t place an unusual amount of concentration on them, so &#8220;automatic&#8221; tasks like locking a door fade too quickly and I&#8217;ll immediately wonder whether I actually did them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wait. Did I leave the stove on?</p></blockquote>
<p>I trust my long-term memory only slightly more.  Maybe it&#8217;s all in my head, but the distrust is real.  Short-term and long-term memory matter when working on a large software project, so how do I deal with my memory distrust? <strong>I. Write. Down. <em>Everything.</em></strong> </p>
<h2>Typical Workflow</h2>
<p>If you peek over my shoulder on a typical day, you&#8217;ll see Visual Studio open on one monitor and Sublime Text open on the other.  I usually spend more keystrokes typing into Sublime than VS.</p>
<p>I typically have one text file per topic branch, naturally with the same name as that branch.  As I work on a feature or diagnose a bug, my train of thought winds up in that file.  I document experiments, research of the relevant parts of the preexisting source code, key steps taken, and the like.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m working on a brand new feature, I may not have much to document, as the code I&#8217;m writing <em>is</em> the train of thought and there&#8217;s no point in being redundant about this.  When working on a difficult bug, on the other hand, just about every word that crosses my mind winds up in that file.  Even the puns.  (Especially the puns.)</p>
<h2>Bug Hunting</h2>
<p>Today, I was researching a particularly tricky bug.  The code involved callbacks within callbacks within callbacks, each of which was named &#8216;callback&#8217;.  Fortunately, the bug was trivially reproducible.  Unfortunately, stepping through the code wasn&#8217;t very illuminating.  It became way too easy to lose track of the train of thought.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a useful train of thought, I had to start getting very specific in my notes.  What exact code paths were taken for <em>this</em> input, what exact code paths were taken for <em>that</em> input, where did they diverge and why, etc.</p>
<p>I had some false starts, in which I thought I knew what was going on and later discovered evidence to the contrary.  When that happens, I make a point of keeping the details handy and permanent.  As with scientists experimenting in a lab, <em>a failed coding &#8220;experiment&#8221; is information</em> contributing to the larger effort.</p>
<p>As I got closer and closer to the actual culprit, these notes and experiments got clearer and clearer.  The little bits of information gleaned in the early stages were starting to congeal into a relatively simple and accurate description of the problem.  Once that description became clear enough, it was obvious what I needed to do to solve the problem.  I spiked out a quick proof of concept for the solution, confirmed success, and then realized the end of the day had come and I was better off tackling the remainder of the work with fresh eyes in the morning.</p>
<h2>Cool Story Bro, But Why?</h2>
<p>If I had too much trust in my memory, I wouldn&#8217;t have this document handy first thing tomorrow morning.  Without the document, I would have faced a tough choice around 5:00 today: take a risk and work long mistake-prone hours through the evening while the details were fresh, or take a risk of forgetting it all by morning.  No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>First thing tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be able to relive my entire train of thought in about 5 minutes.</strong>  I&#8217;ll be entirely ready to fix the issue while in a responsible state of mind.</p>
<h2>Coming Soon to A&E, <em>Hoarders: Text Edition</em></h2>
<p>I keep these notes around forever, for the same reason source control tools keep past commits around forever.</p>
<p>Recently, a coworker remembered that I worked in an area of the project that needed to be extended.  He asked if I remembered anything about what I had done, and naturally I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about.  I was certain I had never worked on such a thing.  I did, it turns out, work on it about a month ago.  A quick keyword search through my notes folder revealed my entire train of thought from that day, complete with the topic branch name and date so we could find the original commit history.</p>
<p>A few months back, I was working on a fairly complex overhaul of the way certain events were detected in the UI.  This work involved wrestling with some inadequacies in a third-party UI control.  While fighting with that third-party control, I had performed some experiments with the available events.  One event&#8217;s name and documentation made it seem like a <em>perfect</em> fit, but my attempts revealed a subtle and serious reason to avoid it.  I documented this decision even though I never expected to revisit that event.  A week later, another developer said he&#8217;d found this event and suggested we use it; armed with the details, I could say that it was already attempted, failed, and failed <em>in this specific/subtle/serious way</em>.  We saved ourselves from wasted effort and from the cost of introducing a bug.</p>
<p>All in all, I think the time I spend keeping these notes saves me time and improves the code I write.  They keep me focused in the moment, prevent rework in later moments, and allow me to hit the ground running each day.</p>

			A Peek Inside the Headspring Toolbox</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Here is a peek into the Headspring toolbox.  I did a simple analysis of the tools used at Headspring by analyzing the Nuget package files for a subset of the projects we have in source control.  I created a PowerShell script to pull out the package names from the Nuget packages.config files.</p>

			Headspring Successfully Hosts Inaugural Central Texas GiveCamp</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_2612.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5784" title="Central Texas GiveCamp" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_2612-1024x768.jpg" alt="Central Texas GiveCamp" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Last weekend, Headspring hosted a charity hackathon benefiting eight Central Texas nonprofits. Forty-nine GiveCamp volunteers, many of them Headspring employees, gathered at Headspring’s corporate office for a three-day marathon of pro-bono website design and development. </p>
<p>Headspring jumped at the chance to host the first Central Texas edition of this national initiative.  The Headspring team is community-focused and participates annually in the Accessibility Internet Rally (held in March in conjunction with SXSW).  When we heard about the technology needs of local nonprofit organizations, we knew this would be another fun way to give back to the community and was right up our alley.</p>
<p>The eight local nonprofit organizations included Arlington Urban Ministries, A.S.P.I.R.E. (Awarding Students and Promoting Increased Rigor in Education), Austin Partners in Education, Bluebonnet RCD, Texas Hill Country RCD, Texas Kidney Foundation, TexVet, and Big Dogs, Huge Paws. Our development teams met each nonprofits’ specific needs, including redesigning websites, automating donation processes, creating donor databases, and more.</p>
<p>In the end, 1,029 hours of time and $75,000 worth of in-kind services were donated.<br />

			The Defensive ToArray</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/a-game-of-throws/">A Game of Throws</a>, we saw a frequently-blogged-about gotcha regarding the <code>yield</code> keyword and exception handling.  This week, we&#8217;ll see how there is more than one motivation for using the <code>yield</code> keyword, and when you opt into it for one you get the other whether you like it or not.  This leads to a code smell: littering our code with &#8216;defensive&#8217; calls to ToArray(). </p>
<h2>Generalizing the Exception Gotcha</h2>
<p>The exception handling case from last week is a specific example of a larger potential gotcha: with lazy evaluation, some work <em>happens</em> at a different time than the caller might expect.  It allows exceptions to get &#8220;smuggled&#8221; through try/catch blocks, but exceptions are just one way you might be surprised by the change in the order of events: if your <code>yield</code>ing method has any kind of side effect, the caller is likely to experience the odd order of evaluation.</p>
<p>That can be good.  That can be bad.  It&#8217;s a sharp tool.</p>
<h2>Complecting Brevity with Laziness</h2>
<p>This week, I&#8217;d like to cover another problem with lazy evaluation.  Maybe it&#8217;s really just a corollary of the order-of-events gotcha, but I want to call it out specially because it has to do less with the nuts-and-bolts of code execution and more to do with the emergent human behavior that results <em>from</em> people&#8217;s understanding of the problem: the Defensive ToArray.</p>
<p>There are two reasons to use the <code>yield</code> keyword:  laziness and brevity.</p>
<p><strong>Laziness is the advertised feature:</strong> you can produce a collection&#8217;s items on demand, as the caller tries to loop through them.  Laziness enables awesome things like assembling LINQ queries over multiple statements before finally starting to iterate through the overall result.</p>
<p><strong>Brevity is the tempting, likely-unintended feature</strong>: a really monotonous pattern can be shortened using the <code>yield</code> keyword:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3823991.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tempting to look at that explicit list create/Add/return pattern and say, &#8220;I can shorten that with <code>yield</code>!&#8221;</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3823995.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Or even shorter:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3823997.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>…but even that uses <code>yield</code>&#8217;s semantics under the surface.</p>
<p>The problem is that we opted into <code>yield</code> (or equivalently Select) for the brevity, but we <em>got</em> laziness along with it.  Now we all have to be wary every time we call a method that returns an IEnumerable.  My inner monologue starts to sound like the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is this call lazy?  Would it be unsafe to pass the result around before defensively <em>realizing</em> it with a call to .ToArray()?  If I <em>do</em> that .ToArray() call defensively, am I stomping all over the original developer&#8217;s intentions?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I have to start looking at the implementation of a method I&#8217;m calling in order to know whether or not its result is to be immediately distrusted.  <em>Do I have to finish writing that other developer&#8217;s method with a .ToArray because they were being particularly… er… lazy?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to think that most calls to .ToArray() are a code smell, or rather an in-your-face workaround for a code smell.  Even when it&#8217;s doing the right thing, it&#8217;s too wordy and puts the onus on the caller rather than the guilty callee.  I don&#8217;t want to have to fix the result of another method, and I don&#8217;t want to have to look at a thousand such fixes littered throughout a project.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s Start Communicating Intent</h2>
<p>In response to all this, I have two items on my wishlist.  One is a wish for an addition to C#, and the other we can use in our projects today.</p>
<p>First, I wish that if a <code>yield</code>ing method were declared to return an array or anything that has a constructor accepting an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, that the items be immediately iterated through and packaged as that type.  This way, you could get the brevity while communicating that you are not interested in the side effects of laziness:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3824003.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Second, something we can do today: I wish that we could start standardizing on a naming convention for extension methods similar to Select that are not lazy: Map is a common term in other platforms.  Select would still lazily produce one IEnumerable from another, but Map methods would always do a defensive .ToArray for you.  You&#8217;d have to write a Map overload for every collection type you care about, but there&#8217;s really just a handful of collection types you&#8217;ll care about in practice.  For instance:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3824012.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Without these Map methods, every time you see a Select you have to wonder what the original developer&#8217;s intention was.  <strong>If instead Map was the first method you reached for, then you would only reach for Select when you actually wanted lazy evaluation.</strong>    Reading through someone else&#8217;s code, Select calls would communicate deliberate laziness with potential side effect gotchas, and Map calls would communicate deliberate brevity with no such gotchas.</p>
