			Get to Know a Developer: Justin Mason</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/photo-3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5799" title="Justin Mason - Headspring Principal Consultant" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/photo-3-224x300.jpg" alt="Justin Mason - Headspring Principal Consultant" width="224" height="300" /></a>Justin Mason is our newest team member at Headspring. An experienced developer, Justin joins us from Catapult Systems where he designed and developed a sensor data recording and management application for natural gas and oil drilling rigs. Justin has a passion for the ever-changing landscape of viable technologies and their potential applications, which makes him a great addition to our team of like minded and ambitious people!</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I have more than 15 years of application development experience. In that time, I’ve seen the evolution of the Web. By understanding where technology originated, it helps provide a clearer picture of where it may go.  The uncertainty of how competing priorities have shaped the software applications that are currently available makes it an exciting time to be at Headspring to contribute to the needs of its customers.</p>
<p>I became passionate about Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) because I understood the pain it was trying to alleviate for companies.  Bidirectional communication using binary serialization over TCP that can be easily transitioned to other transportation protocols like HTTP really caught my interest.  WCF has had to keep pace with the industry due to emerging technologies such as Ajax using JSON serialization instead of SOAP. Its use in the background will remain intact while abstractions are built on top of it to facilitate new applications.       </p>
<p><strong>Who are your ideal clients to work for?</strong></p>
<p>The best part of software development is that it has allowed me to work across a wide range of companies. If software can help solve a business problem, we want to work with a company to do it. Then the only other factor is the willingness of the company to come together to work with developers and rely on their expertise to find a technical solution.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I was led to software by the idea that I could get paid to put together puzzles.  Software allows you to use your imagination to visualize a concept and then bring that concept into something others can see and interact with.  When a day goes by without noticing it, you know the career you have chosen is the right one.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>Besides my introduction to software in elementary school using “Turtle Graphics”, I learned Visual Basic 4 along with Relational Databases coming out of college and started my first “real” job.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I like teaching very much.  I owe my own career to friends and colleagues that took the time to show me how to learn the various technologies.  I enjoy the different ways people learn similar concepts.  Having to adapt to different learning styles makes the teacher’s own understanding greater.  As a result, everyone comes out ahead.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I ask myself whether I’ve added to my understanding of something new, or did I complete a defined objective?  Time wasted is usually a result of a lack of clear objectives, or misunderstanding a concept foundational to a new technology.</p>

			Memory Management</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes I get a reputation for having a good memory, but I actually don&#8217;t trust it at all.  When it comes to my short-term memory, I find that simple things slip my mind far too easily if I don&#8217;t place an unusual amount of concentration on them, so &#8220;automatic&#8221; tasks like locking a door fade too quickly and I&#8217;ll immediately wonder whether I actually did them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wait. Did I leave the stove on?</p></blockquote>
<p>I trust my long-term memory only slightly more.  Maybe it&#8217;s all in my head, but the distrust is real.  Short-term and long-term memory matter when working on a large software project, so how do I deal with my memory distrust? <strong>I. Write. Down. <em>Everything.</em></strong> </p>
<h2>Typical Workflow</h2>
<p>If you peek over my shoulder on a typical day, you&#8217;ll see Visual Studio open on one monitor and Sublime Text open on the other.  I usually spend more keystrokes typing into Sublime than VS.</p>
<p>I typically have one text file per topic branch, naturally with the same name as that branch.  As I work on a feature or diagnose a bug, my train of thought winds up in that file.  I document experiments, research of the relevant parts of the preexisting source code, key steps taken, and the like.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m working on a brand new feature, I may not have much to document, as the code I&#8217;m writing <em>is</em> the train of thought and there&#8217;s no point in being redundant about this.  When working on a difficult bug, on the other hand, just about every word that crosses my mind winds up in that file.  Even the puns.  (Especially the puns.)</p>
<h2>Bug Hunting</h2>
<p>Today, I was researching a particularly tricky bug.  The code involved callbacks within callbacks within callbacks, each of which was named &#8216;callback&#8217;.  Fortunately, the bug was trivially reproducible.  Unfortunately, stepping through the code wasn&#8217;t very illuminating.  It became way too easy to lose track of the train of thought.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a useful train of thought, I had to start getting very specific in my notes.  What exact code paths were taken for <em>this</em> input, what exact code paths were taken for <em>that</em> input, where did they diverge and why, etc.</p>
<p>I had some false starts, in which I thought I knew what was going on and later discovered evidence to the contrary.  When that happens, I make a point of keeping the details handy and permanent.  As with scientists experimenting in a lab, <em>a failed coding &#8220;experiment&#8221; is information</em> contributing to the larger effort.</p>
<p>As I got closer and closer to the actual culprit, these notes and experiments got clearer and clearer.  The little bits of information gleaned in the early stages were starting to congeal into a relatively simple and accurate description of the problem.  Once that description became clear enough, it was obvious what I needed to do to solve the problem.  I spiked out a quick proof of concept for the solution, confirmed success, and then realized the end of the day had come and I was better off tackling the remainder of the work with fresh eyes in the morning.</p>
<h2>Cool Story Bro, But Why?</h2>
<p>If I had too much trust in my memory, I wouldn&#8217;t have this document handy first thing tomorrow morning.  Without the document, I would have faced a tough choice around 5:00 today: take a risk and work long mistake-prone hours through the evening while the details were fresh, or take a risk of forgetting it all by morning.  No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>First thing tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be able to relive my entire train of thought in about 5 minutes.</strong>  I&#8217;ll be entirely ready to fix the issue while in a responsible state of mind.</p>
<h2>Coming Soon to A&E, <em>Hoarders: Text Edition</em></h2>
<p>I keep these notes around forever, for the same reason source control tools keep past commits around forever.</p>
<p>Recently, a coworker remembered that I worked in an area of the project that needed to be extended.  He asked if I remembered anything about what I had done, and naturally I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about.  I was certain I had never worked on such a thing.  I did, it turns out, work on it about a month ago.  A quick keyword search through my notes folder revealed my entire train of thought from that day, complete with the topic branch name and date so we could find the original commit history.</p>
<p>A few months back, I was working on a fairly complex overhaul of the way certain events were detected in the UI.  This work involved wrestling with some inadequacies in a third-party UI control.  While fighting with that third-party control, I had performed some experiments with the available events.  One event&#8217;s name and documentation made it seem like a <em>perfect</em> fit, but my attempts revealed a subtle and serious reason to avoid it.  I documented this decision even though I never expected to revisit that event.  A week later, another developer said he&#8217;d found this event and suggested we use it; armed with the details, I could say that it was already attempted, failed, and failed <em>in this specific/subtle/serious way</em>.  We saved ourselves from wasted effort and from the cost of introducing a bug.</p>
<p>All in all, I think the time I spend keeping these notes saves me time and improves the code I write.  They keep me focused in the moment, prevent rework in later moments, and allow me to hit the ground running each day.</p>

			A Peek Inside the Headspring Toolbox</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Here is a peek into the Headspring toolbox.  I did a simple analysis of the tools used at Headspring by analyzing the Nuget package files for a subset of the projects we have in source control.  I created a PowerShell script to pull out the package names from the Nuget packages.config files.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/headspring-toolbox-2.png"><img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/headspring-toolbox-2-1024x564.png" alt="Headspring Toolbox" width="640" height="352" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5790" /></a></p>

<p>The list of tools is by no means a recommendation list, as it includes tools from brownfield projects and greenfield projects started more than two years ago.

I will follow up this post with a list of tools I would recommend for a greenfield ASP .NET MVC website.</p>

			Headspring Successfully Hosts Inaugural Central Texas GiveCamp</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_2612.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5784" title="Central Texas GiveCamp" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_2612-1024x768.jpg" alt="Central Texas GiveCamp" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Last weekend, Headspring hosted a charity hackathon benefiting eight Central Texas nonprofits. Forty-nine GiveCamp volunteers, many of them Headspring employees, gathered at Headspring’s corporate office for a three-day marathon of pro-bono website design and development. </p>
<p>Headspring jumped at the chance to host the first Central Texas edition of this national initiative.  The Headspring team is community-focused and participates annually in the Accessibility Internet Rally (held in March in conjunction with SXSW).  When we heard about the technology needs of local nonprofit organizations, we knew this would be another fun way to give back to the community and was right up our alley.</p>
<p>The eight local nonprofit organizations included Arlington Urban Ministries, A.S.P.I.R.E. (Awarding Students and Promoting Increased Rigor in Education), Austin Partners in Education, Bluebonnet RCD, Texas Hill Country RCD, Texas Kidney Foundation, TexVet, and Big Dogs, Huge Paws. Our development teams met each nonprofits’ specific needs, including redesigning websites, automating donation processes, creating donor databases, and more.</p>
<p>In the end, 1,029 hours of time and $75,000 worth of in-kind services were donated.<br />
