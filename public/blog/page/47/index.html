			Losing Yourself in the Data</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Statistics are king when trying to figure out why something matters, but statistics are God when you need to get an audience of data-driven minds on the same page. I’ve come to this conclusion by being a marketer in a developer’s world.</p>
<p>Often I find myself thinking, “I just know that solution y will solve problem x,” but knowing that will not be enough to convince my fellow developer teammates. Now I am not saying that I’m not swayed by a good statistic, but I can usually be influenced by a trusted teammate&#8217;s feelings, intuition, or experience. Being a D personality (from the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/improve-corporate-culture-through-the-disc-test" target="_blank">DiSC Personality Profile</a>) a statistic to me is no more than a luxury when trying to make quick decisions.</p>
<p>As I prepare to bring my case to the team, feelings, intuition, and experience will not be enough for this group of predominately C’s. So, I start the necessary hunt to provide statistics that will prove ‘solution y’ is truly the answer. Wanting to give my audience of data-driven minds exactly what they want, I quickly become overwhelmed by the amount of data that I can collect and slice up so many ways. And that my friends, is why I am writing this blog!</p>
<p>This blog is a reminder to all my fellow feeling, intuition, and experience folks that find themselves spending days mining data and dividing cell B2 by every other occupied cell in your sheet. Don’t forget (as I recently did) that you just need to find the statistic that most clearly represents why ‘solution y’ is indeed the right solution. I find that I can sometimes avoid this issue by following these steps before collecting a shred of data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down what it is that I am trying to prove.</li>
<li>Write down what data I have access to. And most importantly&#8230;</li>
<li>Ask an audience member what&#8217;s important to them, don’t just assume.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you found ways to not get sucked into the data black hole? Please, share your brilliance with me!</p>

			Continuous Integration: Early Indicators Mean Inexpensive Fixes</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Earlier this year, I bought a car—my first <em>new</em> car. Although it fills me with sanctimonious hybrid glee (it really does), it&#8217;s making me neurotic with instrument panel indicator lights. The low-tire-pressure indicator after the weather turned cold. The insistent exclamation point from the airbag computer in my seat. The glaring amber beacon from the Integrated Motor Assist battery. I&#8217;ve never had so many things go wrong with a car!</p>
<p>Or have I?</p>
<p>Incorporating automated tests into your Continuous Integration build process can feel similar. You&#8217;re suddenly presented with all these errors. Your product seems to be broken all the time. You liked it better when things were quiet and you didn&#8217;t know how bad it was.</p>
<p>There are two reasons I&#8217;m getting so many warnings from my car: It has more systems, more features, more <em>computers</em> than any car I&#8217;ve owned before; and it has more health sensors and warning lights. It&#8217;s better at knowing when it&#8217;s a little unhappy, and better at letting me know. I take care of these little maintenance tasks, and all is well. It never reaches the big, blow-up, throw-a-rod, leave-you-stranded, heartache-on-the-interstate meltdown that results from years of indifferent neglect.</p>
<p>Continuously run unit tests are an army of little health sensors. CI feels painful at first, but it pays off quickly. When the system under test wavers, even minutely, the tests catch it promptly and summon your attention while it is still a small, containable, inexpensive problem. (Provided they&#8217;re running frequently. Once a day is pretty infrequent. Strive to make them fast enough that you&#8217;re willing to run them every time you commit to source control.) Continuous Integration tests keep your problems on the scale of oil changes and tire pressure, instead of engine blocks and radiators.</p>

			Strategic Planning: Writer&#8217;s Block</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The end of the year is traditionally an optimal time for strategic planning.  Although, planning can often feel like the most daunting task to be sandwiched between holiday vacations and family feasts.  There are so many excuses for putting it aside and focusing on tasks with more immediate impact.  Furthermore, there is no plan yet to execute, so writing one involves sharpening knives and awakening your Mojo.  Good ideas have a funny way of hiding themselves behind a blank page.  When faced with this internal attitude, first remember the golden rule of planning:  you are not guaranteed success with a plan, but without one, you are sure to fail.  It&#8217;s best to get started sooner than later. Once you have brainstormed ideas, strategic planning is just a matter of outlining your format and explaining your thoughts.</p>
<p>With that said, I have put together a &#8220;Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts&#8221; survival kit for writer&#8217;s block:</p>
<p><strong>DO</strong> Get some fresh air.  It&#8217;s no surprise the physical activity recharges the brain, so take a walk around your block or building.  It only takes five minutes, and is likely to revive your sanity.  Alternatively, take your laptop outside with you and work in the elements.  You&#8217;ll be away from office chatter, interruptions, and the same stagnant setting that got you down in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>DON&#8217;T</strong> Go to a coffee shop with your laptop.  Coffee shops are typically cited as great work spaces because they offer unlimited caffeine, WIFI, and a community fostering environment.  However, isolation is important when writing a plan.  Planning requires you to focus on harnessing your thoughts, and becoming overly distracted may be harmful to the critical transition from idea to strategy.  Instead, visit a coffee shop when you are brainstorming.  Bring a paper and pen, and jot down notes of whatever comes to you.  Maybe you&#8217;ll hear a conversation or observe some group behavior that will give you a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>DO </strong>Implement a writing schedule.  Allocate your time so that you can prevent total exhaustion. There should be specific times in your day, maybe two hours, designated solely for writing your plan.  When the time is up, put your pen down and move on to the next task.  It may be helpful to have the subsequent task already specified, so as to alleviate the transition.</p>
<p><strong>DON&#8217;T </strong> Be to hard on yourself.  Remember that you are only preparing the first draft; you&#8217;re not married to it.  Even if you finish thinking it&#8217;s perfect, rest assured, someone is going to want to make some changes.  So don&#8217;t take it too personally.  It is much easier to rework the plan once you have it written out.</p>
<p>Strategic planning is important, but you can&#8217;t hang a blank canvas.  The first step is choosing to do it.  How is your company preparing for the new year?</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Tim Thomas</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tim Thomas is our un-official front-end expert at Headspring.  A gamer by any other name, Tim’s history of hobbies and interests have driven him to a full-fledge devotion for design and automation.</p>
<p>His preferred tools are Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Microsoft Visual Studio. To code, he uses HTML5, CSS3, Less, JavaScript, JQuery, ASP.NET MVC, and XNA Game Studio.  Tim has worked with and trained others on these technologies for years, written many blog posts, given presentations, and has used these technologies on many of his personal open source projects.</p>
<p>He’s useful too!  Look at the fine work he did for our new business cards:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/get-to-know-a-developer-tim-thomas/business-cards" rel="attachment wp-att-2307"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2307" title="business cards" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/business-cards-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>I asked him what he is especially interested in right now. He told me CSS3 “for the flexibility and freedom it affords Web Designers” and Web GL because “I see the next big wave of Web visualization being of the three-dimensional variety.”</p>
<p>Tim’s favorite book is <em>Universal Principles of Design</em> by William Lidwell, Kristina Holden, and Jill Butler. He’s constantly engaging his creative mind, as made evident by his expressed desire to “reconstruct the Headspring offices entirely out of Legos.”  He believes it’s important to connect with broader concepts in design and challenge himself. In fact, when asked what he would need if he were stranded on a deserted island, he told me a set of black <a href="http://www.getbuckyballs.com/">Buckyballs </a>would be essential.</p>
<p>Tim has a desire to share his passion for design with the community.  He is a founder and leader of the Central Texas XNA User Group (CTXNA). This organization holds monthly meetings to discuss game development with Microsoft technologies.  He also regularly attends and presents for the Austin .NET User Group (ADNUG) and Central Texas .NET User Group (CTXNDUG).  Maintaining a community presence also helps Tim stay updated with what’s new.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that, when I asked him of an ability he wished he had, he quickly responded “Teleportation!” I could see how this would be incredibly useful in keeping up with his community commitments.  He explained that really he would just like to enjoy traveling more; he feels that this ability could allow him to spend less time in transit, and more time actually enjoying destinations. I asked him if had any particular destinations in mind, and he told me the Pacific Northwest. “After I travel there, I find myself enriched, centered, and more often than not, highly caffeinated.”</p>
<p>With that said, “Cheers!” to Tim and his wife, as they welcome their first child, a baby girl, at the end of this month.</p>

			Guard Rail Programming</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Rich Hickey, creator of the Clojure programming language, recently gave a talk titled <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple Made Easy</a>. About 15 minutes in, Hickey expresses some strong opinions on Test-Driven Development that initially struck me as blasphemy: <em>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re in this world I&#8217;d like to call <strong>Guard Rail Programming</strong>&#8230; &#8216;I can make change because I have tests!&#8217; Who <em>does</em> that? Who drives their car around, banging against the guard rails? Do the guard rails help you get to where you want to go?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Yikes. I&#8217;m kind of partial to tests. I get nervous working with a codebase that doesn&#8217;t have some decent test coverage. I cringe at the thought of whole teams committing untested code all day. Coding without tests is coding without a net, and represents a great deal of expensive risk. If I had a nickel for every time a failing test saved me from introducing errors, I would have all the nickels.</p>
<p>At first, I mistook Hickey&#8217;s point to be one of outright rejection of automated tests, but of course the reality is more interesting than that. What Hickey is really (ahem) <em>railing</em> against is the notion that the act of writing tests first will somehow do my <em>thinking</em> for me, guiding me to a solution without having to reason about my problem along the way. Sometimes forward progress isn&#8217;t just about keeping your keyboard active while you guess-and-check your way to a solution. It&#8217;s test-driven development, not test-adjacent crank-turning (I must admit, though, <strong>TACT</strong> is a pretty sweet acronym).</p>
<p>Tests <em>are</em> an invaluable tool, so wield them deliberately. Use them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>verify the current state of the system</li>
<li>confirm expectations</li>
<li>motivate breaking a problem into smaller pieces</li>
<li>exercise your API to detect pain points</li>
<li>prevent regression</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than thinking of tests as guard rails, think of them as support beams in a mining operation. You dig a little, you put up supports, and you dig a little more. You know what direction you are heading. The supports are a necessary component of the operation, but they are neither the gold nor the pickaxe.</p>
