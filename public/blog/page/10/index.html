			Quashing Incidental Complexity</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This post is the conclusion to a 7-part series on identifying and resolving incidental complexity in your software projects.  It assumes you&#8217;ve already read the earlier posts (linked in the sections below).</p>
<p>The problems I&#8217;ve faced can crop up in any project.  When a concept or responsibility gets applied to the wrong abstraction, we subconsciously start to add workarounds just to make things work at all.  These workarounds take up space, physically as excess lines of code and mentally as distractions from your true intent.  Workarounds beget workarounds, and the problem feeds itself until you think, &#8220;What a mess!  I need to rewrite it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>By placing responsibilities in their proper home, you can combat this feedback loop and keep your code clean.

<p>The act of &#8220;complecting&#8221; two things is to intertwine or braid them together in such a way that creates complexity.  Most incidental complexity in our code comes from getting separate concepts twisted up in ways that make things more complex without moving us any closer to our goals.  Sometimes we intertwine concepts so tightly that we don&#8217;t even realize it&#8217;s happened.  In this post, we&#8217;ll see how I finally untied a code knot that has been staring at me for about two years.

<h2>Assumed Disaster, Assumed Success</h2>
<p>My younger brother will be starting on a PhD in San Diego this fall, and we were recently talking about the drive he&#8217;ll be taking from Austin.  Wearing the Overprotective Sibling Hat, I was asking about his contingency plans should something go wrong: &#8220;If your vehicle breaks down, who are you planning to call for help?&#8221; and the like.  I could tell I was starting to annoy, so I said &#8220;Oh, sorry, that&#8217;s the software guy talking.  Something can always go wrong.&#8221;  In response, he said, &#8220;Well I&#8217;m a mathematician.  Everything is always perfect.&#8221;

<p>Last week focused on identifying an abstraction that was providing no value at all and needed to be removed.  This week, we&#8217;ll see an abstraction that was right in its inception, but had become increasingly complex as it took on more and more functionality.

We&#8217;ve hired three amazing new developers in the month of July! The first of which is Kyle Nunery, Senior Consultant. He relocated from Florida for the position. Kyle lucked out, because his first Friday with us happened to be a quarterly company offsite at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/small-talk-and-big-news/new-office-and-k1-racing/">K1 Speed Go Kart Racing</a>. He and I joined the rest of the crew for lunch at Chuy&#8217;s (yum!) before we headed to the track.  There, we talked with Tim Thomas about the direction of front-end development and how crucial Javascript knowledge has become. Interesting talk. Here are some other things he had to say:

<p>Also, last week we had our quarterly offsite meeting and headed over to K1 Speed for Go Kart Racing. I came in last place and was just fine with it - going fast is dangerous. But the rest of the crowd had a grand ole time racing, bumping and running each other off the track like a bunch of professionals. Oh, we had a meeting too. Key points: the company is still growing strong and everyone still like working here.</p>
