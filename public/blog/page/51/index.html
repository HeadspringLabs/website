			Is an Investment in Updating Our Software Systems Wise?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are choices to be made when running a business. Where to allocate your resources, especially cash resources, ranks among the top. Determining if updating a legacy system, that is getting you by, is worth the investment can be a struggle. Is it enough of a priority? What risks are associated with updating to a newer technology? As well as what risks are there with not updating an aging technology?</p>
<p>As consultants we have helped many clients and prospective clients determine the value of updating their systems. There is not always a need to update. With our 10 years of experience, we have gotten a nice rhythm down for helping businesses decide if investing in a new business application is the best move for them. We compiled a list of questions in a <a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Investing-in-Software-Quick-Reference-Guide-V2.pdf" target="_blank">quick reference guide</a> to help you and your team determine if updating your systems is a good move.</p>
<p>If you have been trying to convince your decision maker to allocate resources in new business systems, this is the tool to help make your case. It covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your system is business critical</li>
<li>Is the system at risk and should it change</li>
<li>What benefits you will gain with newer technology</li>
<li>How much updating a system might cost</li>
</ul>

			Why Generation X Outgrew the Mullet and How We’re Preparing for the Future</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I was a teen of the 80s, and I have fond memories of that time in my life. The creation of MTV, fashion, music and even the TV shows I watched. However, others might view this as a time of bad hair, horrible fashion and terrible music. I lived through the Reagan Era and Challenger disaster and watched the Berlin Wall come down. I’m part of Generation X, those born around 1960-1976.</p>
<p>The newly conservative age group, 16 percent (about 50,000 people) of the U.S. population in 2009, that was concerned with creating successful futures for ourselves as they focused on college and careers took their world to new heights of material wealth and eventually personal stress. However, the shift in priorities from the social revolutions that captured the attentions of our counter-cultured parents of the baby boom generation also had a huge effect on family values.</p>
<p>My generation, Generation X, witnessed the divorce rate double as our parents embraced the concept as socially acceptable. The effects of social changes led Generation X to focus on careers first and families later. The new path in life, however, has led to a double-role situation unseen by previous generations. Generation X emphasized career first, and therefore, got married later and had children even later than all previous generations – I think I might have been the exception to this rule. I got married when I was in college. Now, many X’ers are busy taking care of their young children and spouses, as well as their parents who have grown old and need their help now, too.</p>
<p>Although I’m not at the point of needing to help my parents yet, I’ve seen and heard how becoming a parent to your parent can be an emotional wrenching process. According to an AARP study, an estimated 34 million Americans serve as unpaid caregivers for other adults, usually elderly relatives, and that they spend an average 21 hours a week helping out. In addition, millions more adult children are calling regularly, flying into town every few weeks or months or just stopping by to take Mom or Dad to the doctor. Also, there are big decisions that sometimes have to be made – from living arrangements, medical decisions, legal rights, etc. and all of this can have a strain on the family. Although most of us would view this as a minor sacrifice or no sacrifice at all, it still can have a physical, financial and emotional toll.</p>
<p>As a Gen X’er, I’ve been thinking more about how best to prepare for this – especially since my wife and I have both of our parents to worry about. Have you been planning? Are you currently in a dual-role of taking care of your family and your aging parents?</p>
<p>As for the mullet, well, isn’t it obvious why we stopped that trend?</p>

			Headspring’s First Intern</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Logan Turner graduated in May 2011 from Grace Academy in Georgetown, Texas. Instead of taking the summer off to go on vacations, spend time with friends and sleep in like most teenagers, Logan decided to get an internship before going off to college. Currently a freshman at LeTourneau University, Logan interned with us at Headspring this summer to learn the ins and outs of being a business software consultant and to prepare for his future career as an engineer.</p>
<p>Logan is a bright and ambitious student who wanted a more technical and career-oriented summer experience before he went off to college in the fall. After acing a technical interviewing process filled with several interviews and tests, Logan began a beneficial summer of learning how to improve his programming skills. As a productive member of the team, Logan assisted on multiple projects and was able to put what he knew into practice and learn what this career path looks like from our employees.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to seeing Logan develop his skills in the next few years and starting a successful career!</p>
<p>Logan’s school, Grace Academy, also wrote a great <a href="http://www.graceacademy-gt.org/index.php/ga-graduate-internship" target="_blank">article about his internship</a>.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is interested in an internship position at Headspring, start the process <a href="http://www.headspring.com/careers/">here</a>.</p>

			You Could Have Invented Lambda Expressions</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Delegate types and lambda expressions have been a part of the .NET tool belt for a while now, so they show up everywhere. If you&#8217;ve ever used StructureMap, AutoMapper, ASP.NET MVC and the like, then you&#8217;ve surely run into them. Despite this, delegates and lambdas tend to confuse developers when first encountered. Even when you get comfortable with the syntax as it&#8217;s used in your favorite library, you might not really be familiar with what they <em>are</em> or how they allow for such seemingly magical statements.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pretend that delegate types and lambdas don&#8217;t exist yet, and then reinvent them in terms of other .NET concepts that are more widely understood.</p>
<p>Suppose we have been given an IEnumerable&lt;Customer&gt; and we want to filter that down to the list of those customers who live in Texas. Without delegates, we could write the obvious loop like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1253799.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Yeesh. I have written foreach-if-add loops a thousand times. Whenever we find ourselves writing virtually the same thing again and again, we should take a step back and think, &#8220;Is there a deeper concept here I could pull out into a library?&#8221; We have some subtle code duplication whenever we write foreach-if-add loops.</p>
<p>To remove duplication, we first identify what parts vary from one instance of the pattern to the next. For foreach-if-add loops, the things that vary are the type of the items being filtered, and the if-statement&#8217;s condition expression. To bottle up the foreach-if-add loop, we need a new method that takes in the condition as an <em>argument</em>. Without delegates, we could deal with this using an interface:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1253795.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Ok, so we&#8217;ve pulled out the foreach-if-add loop into a reusable <code>Where</code> extension method. Still, though, that&#8217;s a lot of boilerplate code: every time we want to call <code>Where</code> with a new filter, we have to bottle it up in a whole new class.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start removing boilerplate code until we&#8217;re left with delegates! With this example, we can <strong>imagine a whole family of interfaces that have one thing in common: interfaces with a single method named <code>RunMe</code>, whose implementing classes contain only that method.</strong> If we knew this family of interfaces only have one method, and its name was always <code>RunMe</code>, then we could avoid even writing its name: <code>condition.RunMe(item)</code> could be shortened to simply <code>condition(item)</code>. Since the relevant part of a single <code>IFilterCondition</code> implementation is the body of the now-nameless method, we should be able to simply provide the code for that method inline:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1253808.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>We can imagine that this use of the <code>delegate</code> keyword is just shorthand for an instance of a class implementing our single-method interface.</strong></p>
<p>Since most of these small unnamed classes exist just to evaluate and return a single expression, we might as well get rid of the <code>return</code> keyword and braces. Since we already know what the item type T is, we might as well leave out the type declaration of the <code>customer</code> parameter, allowing the compiler to fill in the blank. We&#8217;ll need <em>something</em> between the argument list and the return expression so the compiler knows which is which, so we introduce the =&gt; operator. This makes the <code>delegate</code> keyword redundant, leaving us with some valid (and clean!) C#:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1253881.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to delegates and lamda expressions, but in most cases I find it easiest to reason about them as shorthand for the interfaces and classes we would have otherwise used.</p>
