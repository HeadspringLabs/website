			Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 2</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In my <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/customizing-visual-studio-with-external-tools-part-1">previous post</a> I showed you how to configure your own External Tools in Visual Studio, such as a command that opens up the current document in an external text editor, or a tool that launches a custom deployment executable. External Tools by default are accessed through the Tools menu, but this is lame. In this post I’ll show you to create your own toolbar to contain your tools so they are no more than one click away.</p>
<h2>Creating a custom toolbar</h2>
<p>To create a custom toolbar, click Tools &gt; Customize&#8230; or right-click in the open space in the toolbar area and select “Customize…” at the very bottom of this context menu. Click “New…” to create a new toolbar and give it a name and click OK, then close this dialog box.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image4.png" alt="Creating a new toolbar" width="445" height="456" border="0" /></p>
<p>It may appear that nothing has happened, but your toolbar has been added, it’s just empty. Look closely at your toolbars and you should be able to spot it:</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image5.png" alt="Customize your toolbar" width="204" height="77" border="0" /></p>
<p>Click on the arrow, then “Add or Remove Buttons” then “Customize”. From this dialog, click “Add Command…”. Here you’ll see two lists, one for categories and another for the commands associated with the selected category.  Find and select the “Tools” category, then select the “External Command 1” command.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image6.png" alt="Add commands to your toolbar" width="494" height="355" border="0" /></p>
<p>The process is certainly a little cumbersome, but you’ll get the hang of it after doing it once or twice. The “External Commands” listed in the Commands window correspond with the external tools you have [previously configured –link to post #1]. It’s not magical enough to know the name of the external tools you’ve configured, so you’ll have to keep track of what you’ve created and the order they are in. In my example, I have three external tools configured, and I’m going to add each of them to my toolbar: External Command 1, External Command 2, and External Command 3.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image7.png" alt="External Commands correspond to the External Tools you have, in order" width="324" height="229" border="0" /></p>
<p>When you are done, close out any remaining open dialogs and your custom toolbar should be all set!</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image8.png" alt="A custom toolbar!" width="266" height="42" border="0" /></p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Pedro Reys</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/get-to-know-a-developer-pedro-reys/pedro" rel="attachment wp-att-3276"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3276" title="pedro" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pedro-291x300.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="240" /></a>This week I spent some time getting to know Pedro Reys, one of our Senior Consultants at Headspring.  We had a great time talking about <em>consuming</em> technology, and what that means in the past, present and the future.  While we both agreed that invention of indoor plumbing (originally my suggestion) was an important milestone in technology, the internet has ultimately surpassed any and all twenty-first century technical advancements.  Here’s how the rest of our conversation went:</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about how you progressed from a good developer to a great developer.</strong></p>
<p>Since joining Headspring, I do more back-end work than front-end work, but that wasn’t on purpose.  I did a lot of web development before coming here, and I still enjoy reading up on what’s new in web development.  Part of being a consultant is being exposed to everything, so I have gone from good to great by broadening my skill set.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like most about being a consultant?</strong></p>
<p>I like the exposure and the challenges.  I would get really bored if I was just doing one more of the same thing all the time.  Consulting work is never monotonous because I get to work with all sorts of different companies, teams, and products.  I find that to be a really rewarding process.</p>
<p><strong>What do you wish more people in the tech industry cared about?</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to find developers that 1) know their craft well 2) do their part in the community and 3) have people skills.  Many of our clients come to us with bad experiences from great consultancies that have great developers, but fail in the people department.   Being a consultant has taught me to really listen to the client, focus on a smart solution, and choose my battles wisely.  I wish more developers spent time learning how to communicate with people as well as they do with machines.</p>
<p><strong>What companies do you admire?</strong></p>
<p>Zappos has really great customer service.  I bought a pair of shoes as a gift for someone recently, but they ended up being the wrong size.  I contacted a rep, and he was very understanding.  I did not feel like he was just trying to get rid of me.  He expedited shipping on a new pair, free of charge, no questions asked.  This week, they were hacked, and I got an upfront email explaining what happened and what they were planning to do about it.  I liked the transparency of their email, and how they handled it says a lot about their brand’s values.</p>
<p><strong>What technology do you wish you had sooner?</strong></p>
<p>The Wikipedia blackout really affected me.  I don’t know how I managed to get through college without it.  It would have been awesome to have Wikipedia when I was in school.  Also, I wish I had an iPhone sooner.  How did I get around before?  I know life existed before the internet, but it’s a lot better now that we have it.  It’s much more important to be able to know how to get the information you need faster than just having it memorized.</p>

			Early Experiences With Unit Testing</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/plioi/">Patrick Lioi</a></p>
<p>I got my feet wet with unit testing during a summer internship, before the term was officially on my radar. I was writing a number-crunching library in C, and my tests took the form of short C programs using that library. They would run through several related examples and print to the console when something went wrong. It&#8217;s a shame that I was a senior in college before the concept even came up, but at least I got exposure to it before graduating and entering the workforce. This approach actually helped me to catch a pretty serious and subtle error that I wasn&#8217;t explicitly looking for.</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The project involved a lot of number crunching for an electron-detector that would be mounted on a satellite. Picture a 180 degree protractor stuck on the side of a spinning box. At time 0, we might get a reading of an electron coming from 15 degrees. At time 1 we might get another reading coming from 42 degrees.</p>
<p>These numbers on their own were completely meaningless, because the device was ignorant of the fact that it was mounted on the side of a spinning satellite. 15 degrees right now is a completely different direction from 15 degrees a moment from now. The idea is that we needed to &#8216;rotate&#8217; the raw data backwards, against the angle the satellite would rotate through, to know what direction it really came from.</p>
<p>To complicate matters, the satellite would be orbiting the Earth, and in turn orbiting the Sun, introducing more angles to reverse-rotate. As fuel was consumed, a predictable wobble would be introduced, leading to several other rotations to reverse-rotate. Additionally, we needed to translate the resulting 3D coordinates in terms of a convenient coordinate system: some convienient origin (0, 0, 0) with well-defined X, Y, and Z axes. Different people needed to see the results according to different coordinate systems. Some wanted the origin to be the center of the Earth, with Z+ moving throught the magnetic north pole, some wanted the origin to be the center of the sun with Z+ perpendicular to the plane Earth moves through, etc.</p>
<p>The bottom line was that the physicists would determine exactly what rotations were involved, and how to calculate it all in terms of the initial start position of the satellite and a known time to start the clock. I just had to turn the crank and calculate what those rules dictated.</p>
<h2>The Short Cut</h2>
<p>It turns out there&#8217;s a neat short-cut when doing multiple rotations around 3D axes. It comes up in 3D graphics, too. There&#8217;s a way to build a 3x3 matrix representing a single rotation around a single one of the 3 possible axes. If you multiply that matrix against a single 3D data point, you get a new data point showing where it had really come from. Each bit of the phsysicist&#8217;s work could be turned into such a matrix, and if you multiplied all of these together you&#8217;d get yet another 3x3 matrix representing the <em>combination</em> of all the many rotations. Armed with this, you could very quickly process all the data points without having to do a lot of trig for each one individually. The goal was to have a 3x3 grid of numbers that bottled up <em>every</em> operation to perform.</p>
<h2>My First Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Despite that simplification, <strong>I was sure I was going to make mistakes</strong>. I started writing very short programs to test my matrix-twiddling library as I went along. I had some concrete examples from the physicists and from the satellite&#8217;s documentation to get me started. <strong>Occasionally I&#8217;d be surprised by a result, and would know something was either wrong with my code or with my understanding of the problem.</strong> Not doing so would have been unprofessional, and it would have surely produced a useless mess: a program that would serve only to make the machine warmer for the few minutes it ran.</p>
<p><strong>It was really rewarding to see how the testing effort motivated my approach to the implementation.</strong> It forced me to start thinking in terms of the smaller building blocks. Once I was confident in the individual parts, I&#8217;d write the next set of tests at a higher level to test how those parts worked together. I generally hate Lego analogies for writing software, but there was a nearly-audible plasticky <em>click</em> whenever a new operation started passing its tests.</p>
<h2>The Payoff, or Why We Should All Be Right-Handed</h2>
<p>Eventually this testing found a <em>very big</em> discrepancy between the explanation of the rotations involved, and the documentation of the satellite, even though both documents were intended as a matching set.</p>
<p>In middle school Algebra, we always draw +Y moving up the page, and +X moving to the right of the page. That&#8217;s just a convention; it makes sense only because we&#8217;re all agreeing that we will do it that way. When you introduce 3D, you have to decide whether the +Z axis is coming &#8220;up&#8221; out of the page, or &#8220;down&#8221; into the table the page sits on. One of these is called a left-handed system, and the other is called a right-handed system. Again, it&#8217;s just convention; if everyone agrees on what we&#8217;re using, everything is fine.</p>
<p>The satellite&#8217;s examples used the opposite +Z from the documentation of the angles to reverse-rotate. Every time we needed to rotate around Z, we were going in the wrong direction!</p>
<p><strong>I never would have discovered this problem if I hadn&#8217;t been building up a test-suite alongside the library.</strong> It was just dumb luck that I got to experience a unit-testing &#8220;A-HA!&#8221; moment so long ago, but I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>

			Joining the Dark Side: Learning to Code With Grace and Dignity</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Upon the suggestion of a coworker I joined 342,787 people (and counting) with a 2012 resolution to learn how to code.  It’s called <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear</a>, presented by <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0">CodeAcademy</a>, supported by companies like YCombinator, and made viral by the addition of my fellow student, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/05/bloomberg-codecademy/">Michael Bloomberg</a>.   It’s a very simple, learn as you go platform, with big clean buttons and “dumbed down” explanations for the average Joe (or Jill).  I get an email every Monday with a new lesson to work on for the week.  As I progress, I earn badges and bragging rights to publish on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>There are a number of courses and levels to choose from, and I have just completed the first one, “Getting Started with Programming”.  After creating an account, I can sign in and access courses that I am working on and track my progress.</p>
<p>Here are a couple screen shots which demonstrate the clean design and learning module:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/joining-the-dark-side-learning-to-code-with-grace-and-dignity/code-academy-courses1-2" rel="attachment wp-att-3178"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3178" title="code academy courses1" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/code-academy-courses11-1024x554.png" alt="" width="614" height="332" /></a><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/joining-the-dark-side-learning-to-code-with-grace-and-dignity/code-academy-lesson1" rel="attachment wp-att-3155"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3155" title="code academy lesson1" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/code-academy-lesson1-1024x554.png" alt="" width="819" height="443" /></a></p>
<p>Now, let me take the time to clearly state that <strong>I have absolutely no intention of becoming a programmer</strong>. If I wanted to be a programmer, there are plenty of resources out there for entering a career in programming, all of which existed long before CodeAcademy came along.  What attracts me to this particular platform is that it is built specifically for non-technical people to learn how to think like a technical person when needed.</p>
<p>I can already tell this is going to be a very beneficial process for me.</p>
<p>I am surrounded by developers at work and at home, and I have found that they are a unique breed of communicators.  You see, in marketing, we care about the ideas, elaborating on them, and we don’t care much for the process of getting from A to B.</p>
<p><strong>Conversely, developers (good ones) care about the process just as much as they care about the conclusion</strong>.  Words, steps, and systems are really important to them.  They think the way code looks!  If a statement at the top of a string of code does not compute correctly, then the statement at the bottom of the string of code cannot compute either, <em>even if</em> that second statement is true.  Let me demonstrate with a snippet from Lesson 8 of “Getting Started with Programming”:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The while loop defined in the editor code won&#8217;t ever run because its condition, times <code>&gt;</code> 0 <code>&amp;&amp;</code>times <code>&lt;</code> 3, is never true since times <code>=</code> 0 and the two conditions 0 <code>&gt;</code> 0 <code>&amp;&amp;</code> 0 <code>&lt;</code> 3 evaluates tofalse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If the conditions of the loop aren&#8217;t met, the code will be skipped entirely.</p>
<p>Does this read like a familiar scenario? Now that I have been exposed to the process of coding, I am starting to notice the similarities between speaking to a developer and reading what a developer creates.</p>
<p>And the benefits don’t stop with enhanced communication.  I’m looking forward to being a more versatile teammate, not having to ask so many questions, and the possibility of using code to make my daily tasks easier.</p>
<p>But don’t take my word for it.  There are plenty of helpful blogs out there that detail the benefits of learning to code, like this one: <a href="http://www.giftrocket.com/why-marketing-bd-should-learn-to-code">10 Reasons Why Marketing and BD Professionals Should Learn to Code</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have ever considered learning how to code, I encourage you to visit <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear.com</a>, or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23codeyear">#codeyear</a> trending topic on Twitter (follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/headspring">@headspring</a> while you&#8217;re there).</p>

			Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Visual Studio has some deep customization options and extensibility points that many of us just ignore. Once such option is “External Tools” which allow you to create a menu item (and optional toolbar) that can run any external program you wish.</p>
<p>I recently had to set up a couple of new computing environments so I went through my typical routine of setting up <em>Explorer.exe</em> as an external tool, and while doing so I pondered a few other tools that might be useful. In this and subsequent posts, I’ll describe how to set up some simple external tools, create a custom tool bar for them and even add them to the context menu.</p>
<p>In your menu, go to <strong>Tools &gt; External Tools</strong>. You may already have some present like Dotfuscator or a Guid generator.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border-style: initial;border-color: initial;border-width: 0px" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image2.png" alt="Visual Studio External Tools" width="371" height="362" border="0" /></p>
<p>Setting up a tool is fairly simple: You can see above I have Windows Explorer configured with the /select argument to select the file based on the $(ItemPath) variable. More on this on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ekbzk5f8.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN – Arguments for External Tools</a>. When you launch this tool it will open Explorer to the currently active/selected file (either in your editor or the one selected in your solution explorer). I find it a handy shortcut when I need to explore to a file deep within a solution.</p>
<h2>Other External Tools</h2>
<p>I recently added my other favorite editor, <em>Notepad++,</em> to my tools.  Instead of exploring to the currently active file, it will open it up in Notepad++ which is where I find myself editing project files, csv files and other documents that I don’t need to edit with Visual Studio. You can configure Notepad++ with:</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Notepad++ (or anything you wish)</p>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: C:Program Files (x86)Notepad++notepad++.exe (location of the exe)</p>
<p><strong>Arguments</strong>: $(ItemPath)</p>
<p>At Headspring, we use the open-source <a href="https://bitbucket.org/headspringlabs/tarantino/wiki/Home" target="_blank">Tarantino Project</a> to deploy many of our applications. On some projects the deployer executable resides somewhere in a <em>lib</em> folder within the project which means you have to walk through at least a few directories to get to it. I recently made a batch file to launch it straight from the command line from the root of a project, and so I went ahead and turned this .bat file into an external tool while I was at it.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Tarantino Deployer</p>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: $(SolutionDir)..Deploy.bat</p>
<p><strong>Arguments</strong>: /min (this hides the cmd window)</p>
<p>The Deploy.bat file sites in the same folder as the .sln file does and simply points to the relative location of the deployer exe:</p>
<p>@echo off<br />
Start /D.libdeployer .libdeployerTarantino.Deployer.exe</p>
<h2>Launching External Tools</h2>
<p>Once you’ve set up your tools in the dialog shown above, they will appear in your tools menu like so:</p>
