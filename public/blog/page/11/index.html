			Code Whittling</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Reading other people&#8217;s code is a valuable learning exercise, but it can be very difficult no matter how experienced or talented the original developers were.  It&#8217;s tough to read other people&#8217;s code, especially on projects you are unfamiliar with.  You may be a fan of an open-source project, and want to learn from it, but get lost once you start trying to read through it.  Even if the project was exceptionally well-written, the size of the project and its unfamiliar concepts may be obstacles to an outside observer.</p>
<p>In recent months, I tried to learn how two open-source projects work: <a href="https://github.com/hibernating-rhinos/rhino-licensing">Rhino Licensing</a> and <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/">xUnit</a>.  In each case, I immediately ran into the typical problem: I didn&#8217;t know where to start to really get a feel for how these projects work, and the thought of just opening Solution Explorer and reading through each file in random order just didn&#8217;t seem like it would be useful.</p>
<p>Our brains don&#8217;t work like IDEs.  I can&#8217;t just read 100,000 lines of code and expect to retain enough of that information to be useful.  Instead, I took a different tack.  When I&#8217;m actually working on a team project, I don&#8217;t find myself sitting still, idly reading thousands of lines of code straight through.  That would be ridiculous, so why was I about to do precisely that to learn about these other projects?</p>
<p>Instead of pointlessly trying to read and remember everything, I wanted to pursue two other goals simultaneously: engaging with the code like an active contributor while discovering and honing in on the most relevant parts.</p>
<p><strong>Act like a contributor:</strong>  When working on a real project for a client, I don&#8217;t just sit there and read the team&#8217;s contributions straight through, for the same reason that didn&#8217;t work while reading other people&#8217;s open-source projects.  Instead, we all gain an understanding of a project over time, <em>through active and repeated interaction with the code</em>.  I need to implement feature X, which is similar to feature Y, so I start searching for feature Y.  Maybe I compare its implementation to the user interface.  Maybe I see something surprising that I would have forgotten to do in my own feature.  Heck, maybe I find a bug, or a way to make both features share most of their implementation.  Maybe it&#8217;s not obvious how a particular identifier affects the system, so I do an <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/escape-analysis/">escape analysis</a> for it&#8230;</p>
<p>In all of these activities, our hands are glued to keyboards: writing code, refactoring code, searching through code paths, and the like.  If we simulate these activities while trying to learn about someone else&#8217;s open-source project, we are more likely to benefit from the activity in the same way we benefit from these activities on our own &#8220;real&#8221; projects.</p>
<p><strong>Hone in on what&#8217;s relevant:</strong>  Large projects are daunting, and small projects aren&#8217;t.  Usually, there is a particular part of a project you happen to use the most and are interested in learning about.  Everything else in the project is a distracting obstacle.  By deliberately removing the parts that aren&#8217;t too important to you, it&#8217;ll be easier to focus on the parts you do care about.</p>
<p>I like to think of this combined activity as &#8220;Code Whittling&#8221;.  You destroy a project from the outside in, learning about it as you go.</p>
<h2>Destroying a Project</h2>
<p>I started by creating a throwaway clone of the tool I wanted to learn about.  Then, I thought of its features from the point of view of someone <em>using</em> it within their own project, and identified the main features that I <em>don&#8217;t</em> care about.  These feature may very well be useful, but were unrelated to the ones I really wanted to learn about.  I started violently removing those &quot;irrelevant&quot; features left and right.  After gutting the major features I wasn&#8217;t interested in learning about, I was left with a smaller task and had a better feel for the high-level organization of the project.</p>
<p>Even at this point, though, I didn&#8217;t stop whittling.  Within the features I <em>did</em> care about, there were now some unused classes, unused methods, and unused fields, some identified by ReSharper.  I started removing these, too, which in some cases had a cascading effect.  This step left me with the code that I really wanted to learn about.</p>
<p>Armed with the confidence of working with something that was now smaller and somewhat familiar, I started applying small refactorings.  Within a pefectly good and still-used method, I would try to rewrite parts in my own style.  &quot;If I was the original contributor, how would I have implemented <em>this</em> tiny bit here?&quot; or, &quot;If I was going to write an alternative project, what would I have named <em>that</em> concept?&quot;</p>
<p>I found that actually <em>working</em> with the code like this, even though the &quot;work&quot; itself was not strictly productive, helped me to get a better understanding of the project than I would have gotten simply reading through it all.  This activity kept me focused, and helped me to see the major concepts through the eyes of the real contributors, all while honing in on the information I was originally after.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we&#8217;ll walk through this process on a few open-source projects, starting with my previous experiences whittling Rhino Licensing and xUnit.</p>

<h2>The Windows Installer Runtime Sequence</h2>
<p>When a software installation actually takes place, there&#8217;s actually a certain sequence of events that Windows Installer follows.  It&#8217;s critical to understand this sequence for several reasons.  The entire sequence isn&#8217;t always guaranteed to run (the user might perform a silent install), and only certain parts of the sequence are transactional and you don&#8217;t want to affect the target machine outside that range of events.</p>
<p>The installation process is divided into two phases:  the UI or acquisition phase, and the execution phase.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/nolan/creating-windows-installers-with-the-wix-toolset-part-04/phasesofaninstall/" rel="attachment wp-att-6310"><img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/phasesOfAnInstall.png" alt="Diagram with UI or Acquisition phase followed by Execution phase with immediate mode and deferred mode. Rollback arrow across execution phase." title="Phases of a Windows Install" width="649" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6310" /></a></p>
<h3>UI/Acquisition phase</h3>
<p>This is usually the first phase.  This is the phase where the user is presented with a series of screens guiding them through the install process, possibly asking for any needed information and perhaps providing a chance to customize the location on the filesystem to install the application.</p>
<p>However, if the user performs a silent install, this phase will be skipped!  Because of this you need to be sure that you have default values or actions for anything you prompt the user for.  You also need to be sure not to perform any setup actions in this phase because it might not run.</p>
<h3>Execution phase</h3>
<p>This is the second phase where Windows Installer actually performs the install.  Unlike the UI phase it will always run, and it does so in two modes that are rather confusingly named:  immediate and deferred.</p>
<p>In immediate mode, Windows Installer scans through the entire MSI and prepares a script of steps to execute to perform the installation.  It doesn&#8217;t actually make any changes at this point, it just compiles all the specified resources and actions into a transcript to be applied after the entire MSI is scanned and compiled into the transcript.</p>
<p>In deferred mode the compiled transcript of changes is actually applied to the target computer.</p>
<h3>Rollback</h3>
<p>If at any point during the execution phase an error occurs, Windows Installer will halt and perform a rollback of all operations previously applied.  This makes the execution phase transactional - either the entire set of operations is applied, or none of them.  As always there are some caveats and exceptions around this (e.g. running a custom action method that doesn&#8217;t have a compensating rollback method), but all basic file operations will be undone.</p>

<h2>Free Options</h2>
<p>There are several free options for authoring Windows installers, including WiX.  One of these is Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS).  NSIS was created a number of years ago in order to distribute a media player called Winamp.  Some reasons to consider NSIS are that it&#8217;s relatively simple and straightforward to learn, and it supports a plugin system to extend it.  Some reasons to avoid NSIS are it&#8217;s relatively old (the last release was in 2009), and the size of the community using it has been dwindling as a result.  You can check out NSIS <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.</p>
<p> Another free option with a lot of current traction is Inno Setup.  It&#8217;s been around nearly as long as NSIS and is being more actively updated.  It has a custom Pascal scripting engine to customize the install process, and appears to have a few features (such as Unicode support) that NSIS doesn&#8217;t.  You can find out more at the Inno Setup <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">website</a>.</p>
<p> Both NSIS and Inno Setup have one major drawback compared to WiX - neither use the Windows Installer system in Windows discussed in a previous <a href="http://www.headspring.com/nolan/creating-windows-installers-with-the-wix-toolset-part-02/">part</a>.  Whether or not this matters depends on whether your application targets consumers or corporations.  Consumers are not going to care much HOW software installs on their machine as long as it works and doesn&#8217;t silently add malware.  Corporations on the other hand have concerns well beyond the average consumer.  This includes things like inspecting the contents of the installer for worrisome system configuration changes, customizing the installer with separate transforms to meet IT standards, and safely allowing nonadmin users to run an installer that needs some admin privileges.  There&#8217;s a great discussion about the advantages of Windows Installer at <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/11670/advantages-of-using-msi-files/274609#274609">ServerFault</a> (msi files are Windows Installer packages).</p>
<p> So if WiX has all these great features compared to Inno Setup, what disadvantages does it have?  In my opinion the answer to this is easily the steep learning curve.  Because WiX is essentially a wrapper around the concepts in Windows Installer, you MUST understand Windows Installer to use it effectively.  This will be the topic of future discussions in this series.</p>
<h2>Commercial Options</h2>
<p>There are some commercial options that have more polish and user friendliness than WiX.  The two that appear to be most popular are <a href="http://www.advancedinstaller.com/">Advanced Installer</a> and <a href="http://www.installshield.com/">InstallShield</a>.  I have not used either because my installer needs are so irregular that I haven&#8217;t been able to justify the licensing cost for an occasional &#8220;one off&#8221; installer project, but if your job responsibilities include fulltime or near fulltime work with Windows installers you probably want to investigate them as an option.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There are a variety of tooling options for your installer needs.  If you have a sufficiently simple software product and aren&#8217;t targeting corporate installs, Inno Setup might be a good fit.  If you have more advanced needs that Inno Setup cannot handle, or your targeting corporations that have deployment requirements and standards, you&#8217;ll probably want to use WiX unless maintaining installers is your primary job responsibility or your company has sufficiently deep pockets for a good commercial tool.</p>

			The Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This week, I was guilty of the dark side of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>.  It&#8217;s not a universal truth, but it does describe a very real phenomenon that we&#8217;re all guilty of from time to time.  This happens when an unskilled or incorrect person is overly-confident in their own ability, while highly-competent individuals doubt their own ability.</p>
<p>Good thing it&#8217;s not a universal truth, or else we&#8217;d all get stuck in an infinite loop: &#8220;I doubt myself, therefore I must in fact be perfect.  I think I&#8217;m perfect, therefore I must doubt myself.  I doubt myself&#8230;&#8221;  Since that train of thought isn&#8217;t useful, the practical result of the Dunning-Kruger Effect is that <strong>any extreme confidence should be treated as a sign that we aren&#8217;t trying hard enough to improve.</strong>  When you <em>don&#8217;t</em> react to your own confidence by seeking out areas for improvement, you doom yourself to stagnate.  That would my worst nightmare come to life (aka the Freddy-Krueger Effect).</p>
<p>This time around, I had false-confidence around a series of refactorings I applied to <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley">Parsley</a> about a year ago.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by setting the scene.  Parsley is a tool for working with complex text patterns, when a single regex is insufficient.  You describe what a successful input looks like by breaking down the overall pattern into several smaller, named patterns called grammar rules.  For instance, if you want to <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley/blob/2d113754b6e3e68a43e624987fb7ed5c4dd99870/src/Parsley.Test/IntegrationTests/Json/JsonGrammar.cs">describe JSON documents with Parsley</a>, you could define rules named True, False, Null, Number, Quotation, Array, and Dictionary.  All these grammar rules are described in terms of the <em>tokens</em> of JSON, the tiniest substrings that still have meaning to a JSON parser: things like keywords, operators, numeric literals, and string literals.</p>
<p>Some tokens are defined with simple string literals:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392649.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Some tokens are defined with simple regexes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392659.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Lastly, some tokens are defined with nontrivial, multilined regexes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392669.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>An important design goal here was to allow users of Parsley to define their regexes under a technically-untrue assumption: you get to pretend that your regex is being applied to the <em>start</em> of a potentially-long string.  You are trying to tell Parsley how to &#8220;peel off&#8221; the next few characters from the raw input.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s how it actually worked, though, we&#8217;d be stuck with performing wasteful substring operations: after matching a regex against the front of a million-character string just to peel off the first few characters, you <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want to actually perform a nearly-million-character substring operation just to represent progress through the input.  Multiplying that waste by the number of tokens you&#8217;d eventually peel off of the original million characters, the waste would add up quickly.  So, I took advantage of some special regex options as well as a &#8220;\G&#8221; modifier, allowing me to compare your given regex against the input, <em>starting at whatever input position I feel like.</em>  I didn&#8217;t want the consumer to care about these details, so I wrote the TokenRegex class to hide these details:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392684.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Excellent!  You can provide simple regexes intended to match the <em>start</em> of a given input, and I modify the pattern so that I can in-fact match at <em>any</em> position we&#8217;ve progressed to.  <strong>Man, am I awesome or what?</strong></p>
<p>Introducing this class <em>was</em> a good idea.  It dramatically simplified the regexes that consumers needed to provide, and sufficiently abstracted away the details and reasoning behind this rarely-used &#8220;\G&#8221; regex modifier.  This refactoring was also a part of a larger refactoring effort, which has also been successful.  I wanted to make it so that you didn&#8217;t <em>have</em> to use all of the moving parts Parsley provides: if you needed a smarter tokenizer, such as one to deal with Python-style indentation, that was ok: I provided useful interfaces to let you hook in your own code for that kind of customization.  TokenRegex was supposed to help you further by isolating all the regex stuff from the rest of the system; if the Pattern class wasn&#8217;t good enough for your needs, you could provide your own and still leverage TokenRegex while doing so.</p>
<p>This week, fellow-Headspringer <a href="https://coderwall.com/ChrisMissal">Chris Missal</a> made a simple request: &#8220;What are your thoughts on giving parsley the ability to match tokens with a case insensitive regex?&#8221;</p>
<p>Armed with all the undeserved confidence in the world, I first replied that I already provided the right hooks for exactly that kind of customization: simply see class A, create a similar class B implementing the same interface while using a case-insensitive regex instead.</p>
<p><strong>Oh. Wait. No. That doesn&#8217;t actually work.</strong>  Not so awesome, afterall.</p>
<p>Even though the entire effort last year was to provide hooks for <em>exactly</em> this sort of customization, my TokenRegex abstraction was working against me.  I had created it in order to hide the use of the &#8220;\G&#8221; regex modifier as well as the convenient RegexOptions.Multiline option, which had the unintended consequence of <em>also</em> hiding the RegexOptions argument from the consumer.  Chris wants to include RegexOptions.IgnoreCase, but I&#8217;m preventing that for no good reason.  It&#8217;s fine that the current behavior is the <em>default</em>, but it shouldn&#8217;t be the <em>only</em> option.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley/commit/c33c63bf870253be503f900482a6d3a65f50180a">The fix was to update the TokenRegex constructor to optionally accept additional RegexOption values</a>, and to allow those new constructor arguments to be supplied by the consuming project:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392698.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>From now on, if I get a feature request on an open-source project, I should never have a knee-jerk reaction of &#8220;It already does that due to my infinite foresight.&#8221;  Rather, I should go on the assumption that I really have left out or hidden something useful, and see what I can learn in the process.</p>

		<p>At Headspring, we’re proud to have amazing leaders who are experts in the industry. Jimmy Bogard, our Technical Architect, not only excels at Headspring but also enthusiastically participates in the global development community. He recently went on a “world tour” to teach and meet developers in Ireland, England and Ukraine.  Jimmy had the opportunity to speak to the following groups. For more information about what information was presented at each event, <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/12/17/dublin-alt-net-skills-matter-kiev-alt-net-slides-code/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p>While the way we program is universally similar, it’s interesting to think about how similar and different developers are around the world. Here’s what Jimmy had to say about his experience:</p>
<p><em>“One of the insights I found consistent in conversations from all the developers is that it seems that no matter where I go, the problems and passions remain the same. Everyone&#8217;s smart, everyone&#8217;s passionate, and the things developers’ care about are similar everywhere. We read the same blogs, books, and even use the same gadgets (when we can afford them). The only global issue was whether to code in English. People don&#8217;t pick English just because an American or Brit is on the team.  What if there are Ukrainians, French or Danes on the same team? The common language is English. We have a hard enough time picking a programming language, but picking a spoken language is even more interesting!”</em></p>
