			Get to Know a Developer: Deran Schilling</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Deran Schilling, Senior Consultant at Headspring,  is new to the team, and we have warmly welcomed him in as an additional web technology and design enthusiast.  After working in education for several years at LSU Alexandria, and Clear Creek ISD, Deran has gracefully transitioned to the corporate world and the Austin tech community.  So far, he has lead a team of Headspringers to participate in this year’s <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/headspring-shows-some-love-at-knowbilitys-austin-air">Knowbility Austin AIR</a>, and has plans for more events and competitions this year.  Here is some of our conversation:</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>In high school, I planned to be a band director, but ended up in a programming class my senior year.  From that point on, I was going to be a developer.  Lucky for me the college I chose has a great music program and CIS program.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Yes I do.  In my previous jobs, I would always offer up different training sessions from MVC to jQuery to SQL to CSS to whatever they asked to learn about.  I firmly believe that you don’t fully understand something until you can teach it.  Occasionally, I call some of my developer friends to tell them about something new I learned.  In the conversation, I can determine if I really understand it.  If they ask a lot of questions that I can’t answer, I know I need to learn more.  Hopefully they don’t read this post and know they’re my guinea pigs.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on what I’m learning because I have different approaches for various things, but if we’re talking about a new technology then I gauge my co-workers and some reviews on whether or not it’s even worth learning.  If it is, I’ll jump into Google and find some blog posts.  If I can’t find any blog posts, I’ll buy the book.   If there is no book, I’ll figure it out myself and then blog about it.  This way, there will be a post that other people and myself can reference.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent?”</strong></p>
<p>I gauge it based on how much value was brought to the company or to a relationship.  I value the time in the break room or at our lunches because carefully built relationships are important to a healthy team.  One of the main reasons I wanted to come to Headspring is because they seem very people-oriented.  We all work out of the Headspring office, which I think makes for a stronger team, and we are involved in the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			Detached HEAD State</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, I was investigating a pretty intricate bug, and wanted to determine whether it was introduced recently or had always been present.  I wanted to revert my workspace to an old commit to see if the problem could be reproduced there.  If not, I&#8217;d be well on my way to finding the Guilty Commit That Broke Things.  When I tried to jump back in time like this, I was presented with an unusually verbose warning message that helped to fill in a gap of my understanding of git.</p>
<p>With git, you switch between branches by issuing the command <code>git checkout branchname</code>.  Branches are just convenient nicknames for commits, though, so I knew that you could also switch to any commit using the commit&#8217;s ID.  I tried <code>git checkout 77cdf</code> and was surprised by the following message:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;
Note: checking out &#39;77cdf&#39;.

You are in &#39;detached HEAD&#39; state.  You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again.  Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 77cdf...
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<h2>Branches and HEAD</h2>
<p>Before breaking this down, let&#8217;s review a few basics.  Git commits each have an ID number.  Git branches are convenient nicknames for commits.  A branch points at a single commit by remember its ID number.  Git also has a special pointer called HEAD which represents your current location in the potentially-large database of commits.</p>
<p>Almost all of the time, HEAD points at (&#8220;is attached to&#8221;) some branch.  HEAD points at your branch, and the branch points at a commit ID, so when you ask git &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;, git knows the commit you are at as well as its user-facing nickname.  <strong>When HEAD points at a branch that points at the current commit, and you make a new commit, HEAD and the branch follow you to the new commit.</strong>  Even when you&#8217;re in a fresh repository and haven&#8217;t made any branches yet, the default branch named &#8216;master&#8217; fills this same role.</p>
<p>I understood that much before trying to <code>git checkout 77cdf</code>, but I expected no warning, and I expected that this would put me into a read-only state since no branches were involved.  I was so used to the idea that branches are <em>always involved</em> during the act of committing, and figured that without a branch, a new commit would be meaningless.</p>
<h2>Breaking Down the Warning</h2>
<p><strong>You are in &#8216;detached HEAD&#8217; state.</strong>  HEAD almost always points at a branch, which points at the current commit.  When you jump back in time to a commit that has no branch pointed at it, HEAD is no longer attached to a branch.  HEAD still lets you and git know where you are, but we no longer have an answer to the question &#8220;What user-facing nickname describes where I am?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them&#8230;</strong>  This surprised me.  Without a branch name to follow me to the next commit, what would it even <em>mean</em> to commit?  Later on, I&#8217;d need a nice nickname for any new commits, so my repository viewer could know to show them to me at all, right?  If I commit from here right now, wouldn&#8217;t I just forget the ID later on when I wanted to find it again?</p>
<p>Working with HEAD attached to a branch had influenced my mental image of what it means to make a commit; I was so used to the idea of a branch following you along that I mistook them for two parts of the same action.  In reality, creating a commit and having the branch name follow you are two distinct acts.  You can create a commit without having a branch follow you to the new state.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.</strong> AHA!  If I make several commits in this state, I <em>do</em> blaze a new nameless trail, and jumping away from that trail without first giving it a name will effectively discard my work (it&#8217;s still there, but surely you&#8217;ll forget the ID).  No harm, no foul.  Just an experiment.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again.</strong> Double-AHA!  If I start blazing a nameless trail as an experiment, and then I realize that I don&#8217;t want to discard it after all, I can give it a name.  Interestingly, you can give it a name using the exact same command that you would use to create a feature branch off of master: <code>git checkout -b newbranchname</code>.  This makes sense.  When I&#8217;m on master during normal development and issue this command to create a branch, I&#8217;m really just saying &#8220;Oh by the way, the current commit is now ALSO known as newbranchname, and <em>that</em> name should start following me.&#8221;</p>
<p>To sum up, detached HEAD state is a sharp tool.  Use it to inspect an old commit, or to perform an experiment using an old commit as a starting point.  Be sure to give that new work a name as soon as it stops being experimental.</p>

			How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Data Tier</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At some point in 2005 or so, I started using ORMs to perform data access to a RDBMS. ORMs solved a lot of problems I was running into as a developer, namely all the boring ADO.NET code to deal with reading data and populating objects. Previously, my data mapping strategy was something like writing a bunch of stored procedures and corresponding ADO.NET code that is hard to write and even harder to maintain.</p>
<p>I would wind up with a lot of code dealing with DBNull and such, but not much of the code dealt with actually reading information out. It was annoying. It was easy to get wrong. In my attempt to rid myself of this kind of code, I ditched all the things that SQL Server does well.</p>
<p>Using an ORM, especially with databases with large amounts of data, does not preclude the developer from learning these systems. It’s one thing to say we’re ditching Stored Procedures, but yet another to ignore all of the other things that RDBMS does well, and can very much impact the end-user experience of a system.</p>
<p>I had ditched a lot of things in SQL Server when going to ORMs, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Indexes</li>
<li>Custom SQL projections</li>
<li>Aggregation</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190766.aspx">Common Table Expressions</a> (CTEs)</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, all of the things that make RDBMS work well. It wasn’t the ORM that forced me down this path. It was my own bias.</p>
<p>Recently, we hit an issue where we were wanting to enforce uniqueness of the member’s email in the system. We had a set of code on a user creating an account:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1871924.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This worked well when only one user tried to save their email at any given time. But in a messaging system, we often do things like increase throughput by increasing workers. But that introduces the problem of dirty reads. If between the time the system checks the database for uniqueness and finally saves the member, that email could (and did) sneak in.</p>
<p>So how did we solve this? Not by removing this code, but putting in a unique constraint and an index on that column. Now I’ve <em>guaranteed</em> uniqueness for that value, instead of having just a hope that the value is unique. It’s something that the database does, and does well. So instead of worrying about logic in SQL stored procedures, which I won’t do, I’ll look at what SQL does well, and take advantage of those features as necessary.</p>
<p>It’s the same side of the coin of “use the right tool for the job”. It’s “be aware of what tools work best in what scenarios, and tradeoffs for those scenarios.”</p>

			Are User Groups and Conferences Worth My Time?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I guess I would consider myself an events butterfly. There is not a week that goes by that I do not attend a user group, special interest group, conference or unconference, networking event or some other form of peer to peer learning and networking.</p>
<p>I was recently asked if going to all of these events was really worth the time. My answer to them is the answer I give to everyone. There is always one person you will have a conversation with, one speaker giving a presentation, or one bit of information that makes the time completely worth it. If nothing else, you usually get a free drink or some food out of it. But in all seriousness, I cannot express enough the importance of attending these events.</p>
<p>I am not saying that it is valuable for an individual to attend every event that is going on within a 20 mile radius. I do think it is key to pick groups and events that are not only crucial for the industry your company represents, but also the groups that will help you with your career.</p>
<p>This past weekend I attended Austin ProductCamp, a semiannual event for product managers and product marketers. A message they have consistently reminded all attendees of is “a meeting is only what you make of it”. They suggest instead of messing around with your phone during session breaks, take advantage of your peers that are there to learn more too. Instead of only exchanging business cards be sure to follow up with people. It doesn’t count to just go home and connect with them on LinkedIn. Instead of staying in a session that isn&#8217;t giving you what you need, use your two feet (the two foot rule at ProductCamp) and go to a different session.</p>
<p>Even though ProductCamp is making these recommendations, their lessons and practices can be used to make all events you attend worth your time. What are you looking to get out of the events you attend?</p>

			Improve Your LINQ With .Any()</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>LINQ&#8217;s <code>.Any()</code> method is under-utilized, given the benefits it brings in making your code briefer, clearer, and more efficient. LINQ in general improves the expressiveness of your collection-manipulating code by using declarative statements instead of imperative <code>foreach</code> loops; <code>.Any()</code> is a great tool in that regard.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a representative example:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1877234.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>I want to determine if my to-do list has any items that are late, so I use <code>.Where()</code> to filter my list of deliverables down to items with a deadline in the past; then I take a <code>.Count()</code> of the resulting list, and see if that number is greater than zero. This is a plausible solution, and our years of SQL lead us to write LINQ this way. But it can be better.</p>
<p>Testing &#8220;count greater than zero&#8221; is a programmer&#8217;s way of saying &#8220;are there any?&#8221; So let&#8217;s just say <em>any</em>. As you might expect, <code>.Any()</code> returns a Boolean indicating whether the collection contains any items. Further, you can pass a lambda expression to specify the predicate &#8220;any <em>like this</em>.&#8221; (<code>.Count()</code> takes a predicate, too, by the way, but I really have seen &#8221;<code>.Where().Count()</code>&#8221; in use, so I wanted to start from there.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the new version:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1877236.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In addition to being shorter, this version more directly and declaratively states my intent: &#8220;Are there any late deliverables?&#8221;</p>
<p>This code also executes more efficiently. For <code>.Count()</code> to return a value, LINQ must iterate over all items in the collection, even though I don&#8217;t care <em>how many</em> items there are. <code>.Any()</code> will return as soon as it encounters an item that satisfies the predicate. It evaluates as few items as possible, giving me an efficient and readable solution.</p>
