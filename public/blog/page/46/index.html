			Get to Know a Developer: Glenn Burnside</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/get-to-know-a-developer-glenn-burnside/glenn-burnside-small2" rel="attachment wp-att-2620"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2620" title="Glenn-Burnside-Small2" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Glenn-Burnside-Small2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>If Glenn Burnside never wrote a string of code, he would still be a great leader.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we get the best of both worlds from him at Headspring.  He is a really good developer and a really good boss.  In fact, these attributes are symbiotic</p>
<p>Glenn Burnside, Director of Software Development, is an accomplished manager at Headspring because he is supportive, and grants his employees the autonomy to be creative.  He is frequently celebrated for his unwavering support, coaching and guidance.  He has his eye on the prize, and all the confidence needed to motivate our entire development team.  His genuine enthusiasm for the culture of Headspring trickles through the company and everything it touches. The result is happy employees, a happy Headspring, and happy clients.</p>
<p>He will tell you his secret to project management is list making.  He keeps lists for everything he is responsible for at work, for household projects, for his work as a Cub Scout leader, and for personal goals. He refers to his lists constantly during the day, and he is always adding items on and checking items off.  Whatever he is doing, most people would agree that his goal is to finish it.</p>
<p>However, Glenn’s employees really appreciate him as a manager because he is highly qualified in their field.  As a developer, he is able to give credible advice about writing real code.  Specifically, his employees benefit from his knowledge and experience in developing frameworks that are used by other teams.</p>
<p>Glenn has been programming in C# and .NET since 2000, starting with the very first preview release that came out of Microsoft PDC.  This was back before .NET was even called .NET.  Since then, he’s shipped products on every version of the .NET Framework – 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0. These days he’s spending spare time looking at how his team at Headspring can do more as developers with Powershell to boost productivity, and is looking at NuGet as a tool for leveraging deployment and library packaging.</p>
<p>Before joining Headspring, Glenn was the lead architect for globalizing Dell’s shopping cart and profile management applications.  He led a team of only 5 full-time staff members to rebuild both applications so they had a single shopping cart solution worldwide, that could be globally deployed in under 2 hours for all 5 business regions.  Glenn says, “I’m really proud of this effort because we did it without rewriting the whole thing from scratch, which is what was initially proposed.  I found a way to accomplish what the business needed, at a tenth of the original price.”</p>
<p>We rely on Glenn because of his commitment to creating and implementing quality. Because he cares for his team and the client equally, he is able to deliver maintainable solutions with no surprises.</p>
<p>What more can we ask for?</p>

			Cargo Cult Programming</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>During World War II, Japanese and American troops had to transport a great deal of cargo through the Pacific islands, setting up many short-lived landing strips along the way. Members of tribal societies in the area, who had not seen landing strips and planes before, didn&#8217;t quite understand the <em>how</em> or the <em>why</em>, only the <em>fact</em> that the presence of landing strips and planes coincided with the arrival of supplies. After the war, they would try to build immitation landing strips and planes in the hopes that this would cause new cargo to arrive.</p>
<p>This is an example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a>. The term has since been applied to a wide variety of other topics, when we supposedly-more-advanced people make the <em>exact</em> same mistake. When someone superficially mimics all the trappings of a legitimate scientist in order to support ideas with no scientific leg to stand on, they&#8217;re engaging in cargo cult science. Similarly, when programmers write unhelpful code because it <em>looks</em> or <em>feels</em> like something they ought to be doing, they&#8217;re engaging in cargo cult programming.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was working on a project in which the architects required the team to code the layers of our application according to a very strict pattern. It had all the trappings of a Good Layered Archictecture, but had the opposite effect in practice.</p>
<p>At the bottom, we had a Data Access Layer responsible for making database calls. Above that we had a Business Layer, which our ASP.NET code-behinds depended on. A general fear of exceptions led to a lot of rules about try/catch blocks and logging. It turned out, very little <em>business</em> was actually going on in these methods. They largely just forwarded arguments passed from the UI layer down to the Data Access Layer, amounting to hundreds of methods with the following structure:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1449927.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>The Handle method would serialize the exception to a log file, and then rethrow the exception after wrapping it in a BusinessException devoted to this layer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each of these methods had to have full XML documentation in order to pass code review. Monotonous, you say? No worries, because everyone could install a plugin to automatically write those comments by inspecting the code.</p>
<p>In an elevator pitch, these might sound like good practices. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want your UI layer making database calls, right? You want to handle your exceptions, right? You want to log your exceptions, right? You need documentation, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these decisions were exceptionally costly in several ways. The initial costs came in development time. Imagine how often developers would reach for their copy and paste shortcuts while developing hundreds of these methods, effectively one for each database call. Imagine creating and then tracking down the inevitable copy/paste bugs. Imagine how silly I felt <em>writing unit tests</em> for these.</p>
<p>The documentation was <em>almost</em> always generated by a plugin, meaning that we all very quickly learned to skip over them while reading through the code. Whenever an important comment was actually written, it would therefore never been seen. <strong>A comment that tells me exactly what my code says is not a comment.</strong></p>
<p>The costs were magnified when it came to troubleshooting production issues. Because every exception was caught, wrapped, and rethrown, stack traces became quite garbled and misleading. A similar try/catch appeared in the Data Access Layer, so when you tried to read the log file for a failed database call, the complexity was compounded. Instead of seeing a stack trace that showed the steps from the incoming request down to the actual point of failure, you had to walk through nested stack traces sprinkled with the untrue &#8220;failure&#8221; of each call to Handle().</p>
<p>The costs were further magnified in those cases where we actually did want some specific exception types to fall up to the caller. Here, in order to follow the pattern and pass code review, our try/catches had to get extra clever:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1449930.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>This all <em>walked</em> like exception handling, and <em>quacked</em> like exception handling, but it was really just a duck.</strong></p>
<p>Handle()&#8217;s contributions were the logging of exceptions and the introduction of a layer-specific exception wrapper. Logging is useful, but could be performed by a <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/log4net">logging framework</a> higher up the call chain so that we don&#8217;t have to keep on remembering to include it. The layer-specific exception instance served no purpose other than to remind us that we did in fact have a layer named &#8220;Business&#8221;. Removing the exception handling pattern would leave us with the following:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1449933.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Harrumph. This entire layer&#8217;s contribution, now, is to provide a namespace containing the word &#8220;Business&#8221;. It can be removed entirely. Hide the remaining Data Access layer behind some repository interfaces and you&#8217;re well on the way to an architecture that solves problems. To see where this train of thought eventually leads you, see the <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/">Onion Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>Setting up conventions and patterns for your team to follow can be extrememly valuable, but those conventions and patterns always come with a cost. You have to weigh the cost of including a pattern with the savings they provide. <em>You have to know what pain you&#8217;re solving.</em> Even following a <em>great</em> pattern without <em>understanding</em> can lead to waste. You&#8217;ve got to trust your team members to learn and understand not only what to do, but why to do it.</p>

			Reduce Stress: Put Down the Zoloft and Start Base Jumping</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have never understood thrill seekers.  People who bungee off of bridges or sky dive or walk on hot coals have always confused me.  Do these people not value their life or their safety?  Most of the time, it seems to me that a thrill seeker is looking for attention, and trouble is the best way to get it.  Furthermore, what astonishes me the most about thrill seekers are their cool and carefree attitudes.  Thrill seekers often put themselves in the most dangerous situations, and yet they are generally more relaxed than Nervous Nancy who always keeps herself safe.  Why?</p>
<p>After watching the documentary, <em><a href="http://www.pbs.org/programs/killer-stress/">National Geographic: Stress – Portrait of Killer</a></em>, I finally understand.  In fact, I may be a convert.</p>
<p>This revelatory film exposed me to the physicality of stress.  First, one must understand the biology of it all. When we become stressed out, a series of hormones in our bodies spike as we are exposed to scary or uncomfortable situations.  These hormones mobilize energy away from storage to our muscles.  Our heart rate increases, and our metabolic processes (digestion, immunity, reproduction, etc.) begin to shut down.</p>
<p>Essentially, animal bodies go through the same biological processes of releasing hormones when they are stressed out, only they are typically in real danger.  Visualize zebras being attacked by hyenas – now that’s real danger.  Stress hormones release, and all non-essential metabolic processes shut down, enabling the zebra to fight off its predator. What’s important to realize is that even though animals are exposed to higher levels of danger, they only experience increased levels of stress in brief intervals of only a couple minutes.</p>
<p>But what stresses out a human?  Mortgages, public speaking, walking down the aisle… long term stressors.  Stressors like ours can last days, weeks, sometimes even years. So we are experiencing stressful situations, over longer periods of time, and for all kinds of reasons.  Our bodies are constantly releasing stress hormones because our minds are telling us we are in life-threatening danger over $4 a gallon gasoline.  Ridiculous!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Now, let’s revisit Nervous Nancy.  She recognizes how dangerous the world is, and she wants to protect herself.  However, she is in a constant state of stress, and her body’s metabolic processes are threatened by it.  Maybe she develops a stomach ulcer, and subsequently she may become more worried.  She may get irritable when she experiences obstacles that prevent her from eliminating stressors in her life.  You can imagine the many negative consequences that snowball from here.  Basically, Nervous Nancy may be safe from danger, but she’s a mess.  <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/reduce-stress-put-down-the-zoloft-and-start-base-jumping/istock_000016699925medium-2" rel="attachment wp-att-2410"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2410 aligncenter" title="iStock_000016699925Medium" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iStock_000016699925Medium1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>However, thrill seekers are more relaxed than Nervous Nancy because they are subconsciously regulating their release of stress hormones.  They put themselves in seemingly life-threatening situations in order to better differentiate appropriate levels of stress.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/reduce-stress-put-down-the-zoloft-and-start-base-jumping/istock_000015762365small" rel="attachment wp-att-2415"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2415" title="iStock_000015762365Small" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iStock_000015762365Small-300x189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="189" /></a></p>
<p>What really helped me understand all of this is when I put it in terms of standing heart rates.  Our standing heart rate should be low, because our bodies should not have to work hard to sit still.  The only way to reduce our standing heart is regular exercise.  I now understand that, just like when I exercise my body to reduce my standing heart rate, I should put myself in uncomfortable, thrilling situations to reduce stress levels.</p>
<p>This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Eleanor Roosevelt: “Do one thing a day that scares you.” I don’t think I will be strapping on a bungee cord anytime soon, but I do believe it is time to challenge myself a little more each day.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on what dangerous adventures I should begin to embark on?</p>

Since you&#8217;re already reading this blog, you are probably most familiar with his weekly blog <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/plioi">series</a> for Headspring.  He holds the title in our office for top technical blog author.  Patrick has a strong attention to detail, and this character trait is quite evident in his writing.  But blogging is just what Patrick does in his spare time.  Along with writing, he is also a dedicated developer</p>
<p>He picked up programming with Pascal as a teenager, and never looked back.  “I knew right away that I wanted to write software for a living,” he says.  Patrick is most interested in programming languages and compilers. In fact, he is an all-out expert with C#, focusing on the lesser-known corners of the language.  He has used C# on a wide variety of projects since its initial release, including an open-source text parsing library named <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley">Parsley</a>. He&#8217;s also using Parsley to experiment with a language of his own, <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook">Rook</a>, which should be ready for public consumption, “Sometime around the heat-death of the universe.”</p>
<p>The most delightful thing about Patrick is his genuine nature.  He simply enjoys what he does. He told me, “I get a kick out of learning the differences between programming languages, so I tend to learn more about the nitty-gritty details of the languages I use the most.” He then went on to explain that the styles and opinions promoted by other languages also inform his decisions when writing in C#.</p>
<p>When he is not writing code or blogs, Patrick likes to revisit his favorite book, <em>Anathem</em> by Neal Stephenson:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/get-to-know-a-developer-patrick-lioi/anathem-uk" rel="attachment wp-att-2359"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2359" title="anathem-uk" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/anathem-uk.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="498" /></a></p>
<p>Patrick joined the Headspring team in April of this year, and we are so happy to have him.  To learn more, visit his <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/plioi">blogs</a>, or tweet @plioi.</p>

			Opening the Black Box</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lambda expressions are unusual in the way they are turned into objects at runtime, compared to other kinds of expressions. The object corresponding with your lambda could either be a delegate type, like <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code>, or an expression type like <code>Expression&lt;Func&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. The object you&#8217;ll get to work with depends on what you are passing the lambda <em>to</em>:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1421580.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In the first case, our lambda is received as a delegate type, a function that can be invoked with an integer to receive its square. In this usage, it&#8217;s just shorthand for a method.</p>
<p>In the second case, our lambda is received as an expression type, meaning that the <code>expression</code> parameter&#8217;s value is an object that <em>describes what the lambda&#8217;s source code looks like</em>. The value of the <code>expression</code> parameter is a tree-like object, effectively saying &#8220;I am a lambda expression with an x parameter. My body is a multiplication operation, where both the left and right operands are the x parameter.&#8221; This description of the source code is verbose and traversable, so we can reason about it in a way that would be too difficult to do with the mere string <code>"x =&gt; x*x"</code>. We can also take this tree, compile it at runtime, and evaluate it for some given input.</p>
<p>This ability has been leveraged, for example, to make strongly-typed HTML helpers: <code>Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.ProductName)</code> will generate an appropriate snippet of HTML by traversing the tree of objects which <em>describe</em> the text &#8220;model.ProductName&#8221;. Our HTML snippet will include the given name. By compiling/evaluating the expression at runtime, we can also pick an appropriate control to output based on the type of the property, and can include the current value of the property within that control.</p>
<p><strong>Because the language designers exposed a <em>tiny</em> bit of the compiler&#8217;s internal data structure, we have access to a great deal of information <em>about</em> our code, allowing us to phase out a lot of otherwise monotonous and error-prone busywork.</strong></p>
<h2>Roslyn</h2>
<p>In a future version of .NET, a great deal <em>more</em> of the compiler&#8217;s internal data structures will be exposed as an official part of the framework. This project is called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/roslyn">Roslyn</a>. As part of this project, <strong>the C# compiler is being rewritten in C#</strong>. They should have called it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a>.</p>
<p>Compilers are usually a bit of a black box. Text goes in, compiled assemblies come out, and throughout that process we don&#8217;t get to see the intermediate data structures, similar to <code>Expression&lt;T&gt;</code>, that are used to perform the compilation.</p>
<p>Since the Roslyn compiler will be implemented with .NET, the development team has the opportunity to expose the whole set of data structures to us as an API, similar to the way expression trees are currently exposed to us for lambdas. As with lambdas, trees are used to represent larger constructs like statements, methods, and classes. During compilation, this tree is traversed and queried to do things like type inference, type checking, IL generation, and the like. By exposing these intermediate data structures to us, we&#8217;ll be able to benefit from the wealth of information stored in them.</p>
<p>Tools like ReSharper and your favorite HTML-ifying code snippet highlighter need to effectively reinvent some of the wheels found in our current black box. With Roslyn, we&#8217;ll be able to instead develop smart code-twiddling tools without having to reinvent 80% of a compiler first.</p>
<h2>A Shinier Mirror</h2>
<p>You can think of these trees as providing <strong>suped-up reflection</strong>. Reflection lets us traverse already-compiled code for <em>some</em> of the information the compiler had at its disposal along the way. We&#8217;ll be able to traverse these trees for similar information, <em>before</em> it gets squashed down into measly, stinking IL instructions:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1421585.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Unintended Consequences (The Good Kind)</h2>
<p>When lambdas and the expression API were first developed, the language designers didn&#8217;t necessarily know ahead of time what we&#8217;d do with them. HTML helpers in MVC, for instance, were a creative and unanticipated reaction to the language feature. Now that more of the compiler&#8217;s inner workings will be exposed to us, I&#8217;m looking forward to a flurry of creative and powerful code-twiddling tools.</p>
