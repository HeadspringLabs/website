			The Cobra Effect</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Imagine for a moment that you are a member of the government in colonial India during the period of British rule.  You&#8217;re concerned about the population of venomous cobras, so you attempt to impose a solution.  You offer a reward to anyone who brings you a dead cobra.  After a while, though, you start to get suspicious of some of the cobra hunters.  They seem to be bringing in far more cobras that any single person is likely to encounter, let alone trap and kill.  You discover that some individuals have begun raising cobras in order to turn a profit!  Clearly, your plan isn&#8217;t working, so you stop offering the bounty.  Countless cobra farmers&#8217; snakes become worthless, so they are released into the wild, increasing the population of cobras.</p>
<p>You meant well, but your attempt to impose a solution to the problem actually made things worse.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect">Cobra Effect</a> is similar to the more frequently-referenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy&#8217;s Law</a>.  Murphy&#8217;s a bit of a pessimist: if something can go wrong, it will, as if the universe is out to get you.  The Cobra Effect, on the other hand, has more to do with human nature: you see a problem and attempt to impose a solution on a group of people, and their natural reaction to your solution ends up making the original problem worse.</p>
<p>Cobra Effect problems have 4 parts: a) recognizing a problem, b) imposing a solution on a group of people, c) people react naturally <em>to the solution</em>, and d) in turn that reaction makes the problem worse.  Years ago, I experienced these 4 stages on a software project.

			Take a DIP to Get DRY</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The DRY principle is pretty simple.  Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself.  When you find yourself reaching for the copy/paste commands, you&#8217;re probably creating some technical debt.  If you copy/paste a method or class from one part of your application to another with the intent to make a small change in the copy, there&#8217;s a very big chance that those two implementations will begin to drift.  Maybe a bug needs to be fixed in both, but the developer performing the fix doesn&#8217;t know that the copy took place: they&#8217;ll fix some occurrences of the bug but allow others to continue.  Even when you know about both copies, you may find yourself doing double the work each time you need to make a change to one of them.  It&#8217;s costly in development time, brain cycles, and QA time.</p>
<p>Strangely, I find that when the technical debt brought on by a DRY violation is <em>particularly</em> bad, the solution involves deliberately causing yet more duplication in the short term.  Sometimes, you need to take a DIP to get DRY.

			Migrating a Windows Install to a New Macbook</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently here at Headspring my workstation got upgraded from a PC laptop to a Macbook Pro. While I was excited about the new hardware and taking the plunge into Mac OS X (that’s the Roman numeral ten, not the 24th letter of the alphabet), I still needed to be able to run Windows and Visual Studio. This post summarizes the various options I explored, and my final setup.</p>
<h3>Multiboot or Virtual Machine?</h3>
<p>Multibooting is using a software tool that hooks your computer’s normal power on sequence and provides you a way to choose what operating system you want to load.</p>
<p>Microsoft has supported multibooting since Windows XP as way to install new versions of Windows while still keeping older versions for your legacy software that won’t work on the newer Windows version. It’s also been possible to multiboot Linux and Windows for a long time.</p>
<p>A virtual machine is software that pretends to be a computer, and runs another operating system inside of it. You can use a virtual machine to run an instance of Windows 98 while booted into Windows 7 for example.</p>
<p>The advantage to multibooting is performance - running an operating system inside a virtual machine causes it to run more slowly than it would if it was natively booted - but the disadvantage is you can only work within the one operating system you booted into.</p>
<p>Virtual machines can perform slower, but allow you to run both operating systems at the same time.</p>
<p>I’ve done multibooting with multiple versions of Windows and Linux in the past. It works well, but its amazing how much of a psychological barrier having to boot into an alternate OS to do something gets created. “I got an email response&#8230;I need to go update that spreadsheet&#8230;rats, it’s in the other OS&#8230;I really don’t want to close everything and reboot, I’ll do it later&#8230;”.</p>
<p>The new workstation is top of the line: Intel I7, 16GB memory, solid state hard disk. It would be more than capable of running Windows in a virtual machine without much overhead. Choosing a virtual machine over multibooting was a pretty easy choice.</p>
<p>There were several candidates for the virtual machine software - VMWare Fusion, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop. VirtualBox was ruled out pretty quickly as underperforming. Parallels and Fusion are fairly similar. We ended up going with Parallels.</p>
<h3>How I Migrated My Old Windows Install to Parallels</h3>
<p>I didn’t want to have to start over with a brand new install of Windows, my old setup was perfectly fine. Fortunately Parallels supports migrating Windows from your old PC to your new Mac. It took three tries before I figured out the best way to do it, so I wanted to share and hopefully save someone else the learning experience. It wasn’t painful, but did consume a fair amount of wasted setup time.</p>
<p>There are several options for doing the migration: using a special USB cable you can buy from Parallels, over the network, or copying to an external hard drive.</p>
<p>We didn’t buy the cable, so attempt number one was over the wireless network. Big mistake. It took over twenty hours to transfer, and the virtual machine wouldn’t boot afterwards. Somehow it got corrupted during the transfer.</p>
<p>Attempt number two was copying to external storage. This took about as long, and was going to take another twenty hours to pull off the drive to the Macbook.</p>
<p>Fortunately at this point a coworker intervened and told me using a network crossover would be much quicker.\</p>
<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>
<p>The new Macbooks don’t have a built in ethernet port, so you’ll need a Thunderbolt to NIC adapter for this. You’ll also need an ethernet crossover cable - this is a special cable that crosses the wires from plug to the other, allowing you to connect two computers directly as if they were both on a network. Because it’s a direct connection there’s virtually no transfer overhead at all.</p>
<h3>Performing the Transfer</h3>
<p>On your Windows machine you need to go download and install Parallels Transporter. Start Parallels Transporter. The screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5836" title="Parallels Transporter for Windows" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/parallelsTransporterWindows-300x177.png" alt="Screenshot of Parallels Transporter for Windows with three options: usb cable, network, external drive" width="300" height="177" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Mac download Parallels 8 and start it. Click File..Migrate. This will launch the migration wizard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/001-wizard.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5834" title="Parallels migration on Mac" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/001-wizard-300x252.png" alt="Screenshot of Parallels migration on Macbook" width="300" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>If you haven’t already done so, connect the crossover between the two computers. Choose Network. Choose IP Address instead. Select your Windows computer from the list. Alternately you can use ipconfig on your Windows machine to get your IP address and specify it manually if needed.</p>
<p><strong> When asked how to configure the image, choose Like a PC.</strong> You can customize the settings later, but if you choose Like a Mac, Parallels will automatically copy your Documents folder into your Home directory in Mac OS, leaving you with two copies of everything.</p>
<p>That’s it! Using a crossover took about two hours - much faster than using the wireless network or copying it to external storage. When the transfer was complete, the virtual machine started without any issues (well, almost - I had to reactivate Windows) and I didn’t have to setup (and endlessly tweak) a new install.</p>
<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>I’m still getting used to my new Mac. There’s a lot that’s different from Windows and I’m now fighting twenty years of muscle memory (I started using Windows on version 3.11 in 1993). I plan on writing a follow up post on adjusting from Windows to Mac OS sometime in the future.</p>
<p>The transition pain is more than worth it - there are a lot of advantages to using a Mac with Windows. The hardware is rock solid, fast, and very light (it’s less than half the weight of my old workstation). The Retina display is gorgeous and highly readable. Also of note is the ability to now develop for multiple platforms - I can still use Visual Studio for .NET development, but also write apps for IOS and MacOS as well. Support for platforms like Ruby and node.js are also better on Mac than Windows.</p>
<p>Are you running Windows on a Mac? Are you using Parallels, or something else? Share your experiences or current setup in the comments!</p>

			Mentorship and Pie Potential</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This past summer, the Headspring staff took a trip to <a href="http://www.k1speed.com/austin-location.html">K1 Speed</a> for a quarterly meeting.  When we weren&#8217;t &#8220;testing the safety equipment&#8221; around the track, we were talking about our performance for the quarter as well as plans for the future.  We were asked to imagine a much larger Headspring 1-2 years out, and describe what it would take to get there.</p>
<p>I shared a hard truth, suggesting we start considering more recent grads in our hiring process.  This may seem counter-intuitive.  Hiring talented folks for software development is extremely tough, and real-world experience matters a lot when evaluating candidates, right?  On the flip side, though, most experienced software developers have a long list of horror stories from past jobs: office politics, bureaucracy, teams spread too thin, death marches, and the like.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be great, for both you and the new hire, if they got to skip all that luck-of-the-draw stuff and instead got <em>all</em> of their real-world experience at a healthy company right from the start?</p>
<p>From a candidate&#8217;s point of view, they could enter the workforce surrounded by experienced people who have already faced and rejected all those problems.  They could learn from everyone&#8217;s example far more quickly than they would otherwise on their own, and they wouldn&#8217;t run the risk of being set <em>back</em> by the examples of struggling teams.</p>
<p>In reaction to my suggestion, I was asked to take on a mentorship role with a current student, with the goal of preparing him for an internship here at Headspring.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way things work here: if you make a suggestion to improve things, don&#8217;t be surprised if <em>you</em> get to make it a reality.  In light of this policy, next time I think I should share another hard truth with the team: <strong>we need to be eating more cakes and delicious pies</strong>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve only been meeting for a few weeks, but it&#8217;s already a rewarding experience for both of us.  Once per week and for about an hour, Dan and I meet to bring him up the C# / MVC learning curve.  When we first met at a <a href="http://www.polyglotprogrammers.org/">Polyglot</a> meeting, Dan had some experience with C++ and Lua, but hadn&#8217;t worked with C# yet.  Our initial meetings have focused on the nuts and bolts of C# itself, but even early on we got to cover other topics such as automated testing, readability concerns, the DRY principle, etc.</p>
<p>On the selfish side of the equation, this experience helps me to improve my own skills.  Having to explain things that I take for granted forces me to challenge my own assumptions, and improves my ability to discuss complex technical subjects with clients.  On more than one occasion, Dan&#8217;s questions have left me initially thinking to myself, &#8221;<em>Why</em> exactly, do I feel so strongly about this opinion?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have appreciated having a mentor at that age, but filling the opposite role is looking to be a pretty sweet deal.  Not as sweet as my cake/pie suggestion, but sweet nonetheless.</p>

			Jack Welch MBA Course: Business Communication and Ethics</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Earlier, <a href="http://www.headspring.com/jeffrey/jack-welch-mbaa-new-graduate/">I wrote</a> about my experience at the <a href="https://twitter.com/jack_welch"><a href="http://www.jwmi.com">Jack Welch Management Institute</a>.</a>&nbsp; One of the courses in the program is Business Communications and Ethics.&nbsp; In hindsight, it was very appropriate that this course be the very first course in the program.&nbsp; After an overview of communications and ethics, the course pressed two things very hard.</p>
<h2>Candor and differentiation</h2>
<p>Mr. Welch <a href="http://www.jwmi.com/content/business-communication-and-ethics-candor">contends</a> that “the biggest dirty little secret in business” is the absence of candor (Winning).&nbsp; The course teaches that so many problems rise out of the fear of honest communication.&nbsp; We are reminded that children are naturally candid and have no filter in what they say.&nbsp; It is through cultural conditioning that we learn to hold in what we are really thinking.&nbsp; In some organizations, the culture discourages real candor.&nbsp; Instead, saving face is valued more.</p>
<p>A key example of candor taught in this course relates to performance appraisals.&nbsp; Jack is famous for teaching a 20/70/10 differentiation method where management communicates to employees where they stand.&nbsp; This is most important for the bottom 10%.&nbsp; He contends that it is unfair to the employee to keep that honest feedback from those employees, who may spend more years at the company not understanding why they are not progressing in their careers.&nbsp; Instead, Jack contends that being candid with these employees, and helping them leave, is much more fair to them.&nbsp; The central idea in this is the belief that everyone is a star at the right company and the faster they realize the current company isn’t tapping their unique strengths, the sooner they can find the company and role that helps them shine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This method of candid performance communication drives a lot of controversy, but usually not from the top 20%.&nbsp; After this course, we slowly implemented this method at <a href="http://www.headspring.com/">Headspring</a>, and I have to attest that it works.&nbsp; We do quarterly performance reviews, and we differentiate.&nbsp; Through some conference call questions with Mr. Welch during the program, students were able to ask him questions, and he clarified his method for smaller companies where the law of large numbers doesn’t yield a good 20/70/10 distribution.&nbsp; He said that the benefit is there as long as there is real differentiation.&nbsp; He coaches that management must be honest with itself and realize that not all employees are the same.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Ethics and managing a crisis</h2>
<p>After some academic reading on case studies involving corporate ethics, we were able to discuss a timely scandal.&nbsp; That was the scandal of BP and the communication method used after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; Tony Hayward, the CEO of BP at the time, failed to get out ahead of the crisis.&nbsp; When a crisis happens, the curriculum teaches that leaders need to get out ahead of crisis communication and be the source of new information.&nbsp; Tony Hayward failed to do this.&nbsp; Because of it, news media filled the role of finding and communicating new pieces of information.&nbsp; When the news is coming from reporters, the revelations allude to a cover-up, where there is one or not.&nbsp; As a leader, claiming the role of briefer positions one as transparent.&nbsp; Regardless of mistakes made in a crisis, a worse mistake is not owning and leading crisis resolution.</p>
<p>You can read one of the <a href="http://www.jwmi.com/content/business-communication-and-ethics-candor">lectures of this course here</a>.</p>
