<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This post is a companion to the previous post in Part 5 - it shows and explains the structure of the WiX file that was used to generate the MSI.</p>
<h2>Tooling and References For Editing WiX Files</h2>
<p>Since the name of the toolkit is &#8220;Windows Installer in XML&#8221;, you probably won&#8217;t be terribly surprised to find out that the source files you edit are&#8230;wait for it&#8230;XML. This means you can author and edit in your favorite XML editor of choice, whether that&#8217;s Notepad++, some incredibly expensive specialty tool like Altova XML Spy, or Visual Studio. If you use Visual Studio and you&#8217;ve installed WiX on your local machine, you can leverage the included Votive project types to get Intellisense in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_6409&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;582&#8221;]<a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/votiveIntellisense.png"><img class=" wp-image-6409 " alt="Picture of editing with Visual Studio and Intellisense supplied by Votive" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/votiveIntellisense-970x562.png" width="582" height="337" /></a> Visual Studio Intellisense with Votive[/caption]</p>
<p>There&#8217;s reference documentation for the schema at <a href=" http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix3/schema_index.htm">SourceForge</a>. The first link is for the WiX schema itself, and there are other schema references for the various extensions that are available.</p>
<h2>The Complete Hello World</h2>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014691.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Dissecting the Elements</h2>
<p>Line 3 is pretty straightforward: declare our root Wix element and specify the namespace. No that isn&#8217;t a typo at the end; the namespace really doesn&#8217;t have an x at the end of it. I have no idea why.</p>
<p>Line 5 declares our Product for the installer (recall Product has a cardinality of 1). Some of the supporting attributes like Manufacturer, Name, and Version will show up in the Add Program and Features list for Windows.</p>
<p>Line 12 defines the Package (also cardinality of 1), which is the installer itself. Attributes here will show up in the properties of the MSI file.</p>
<p>Line 19 introduces the concept of Media, which wasn&#8217;t discussed in the MSI examination. Windows Installer has a profuse amount of options for the physical layout of the files to be deployed, including things like spanning multiple DVDs (or floppies - <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/231273/what-are-the-windows-a-and-b-drives-used-for">remember those?</a> The need for this has fallen by the wayside as most software is downloaded from the internet or an internal network these days. In this example, we only have one physical media target, and the EmbedCab attribute will package all the deployables into the MSI directly since we don&#8217;t need disc spanning.</p>
<p>Line 21 defines our target directory structure. Note it&#8217;s nested. I&#8217;m not going to discuss it exhaustively, but will point out a few interesting things. Line 22 specifies we&#8217;re installing into this machine&#8217;s Program Files directory, and line 23 is the INSTALLDIR, which is our root target directory. More sophisticated installers will allow the user to specify their own directory and replace the value of INSTALLDIR.</p>
<p>Line 24 defines our one and only component. Recall from the previous post its possible for a component to have more than one deployable in it, but there are advantages to having a component for every file. Components have a unique ID to identify them.</p>
<p>In this example we&#8217;ve associated our component with a target directory by simply nesting it under the desired directory. This works for simple scenarios, but if you have more than one target directory for your product or if your code generating your component definitions, it might be easier to declare the directory structure and components separately and use the DirectoryRef attribute on the component to make the association.</p>
<p>Line 25 contains a file that is part of this component. The name attribute is what the file will be called when it is placed on the target file system, and the source attribute specifies where to get the file when compiling the MSI package.</p>
<p>Line 26 does what you hopefully would guess; it removes the installation folder from the machine when the component &#8216;MainExecutable&#8217; gets uninstalled.</p>
<p>Line 32 finishes things out by declaring our single feature (although you&#8217;ll recall there could be multiple Features in a Product), and associating our component with it.</p>
<h2>Tying It All Together</h2>
<p>So we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>File HelloWorld.exe containing our executable</li>
<li>Component MainExecutable containing the HelloWorld.exe File</li>
<li>Directory INSTALLDIR (which itself is a subdirectory) associated with the MainExecutable Component</li>
<li>Feature called Complete containing the MainExecutable Component</li>
<li>Product that contains the Complete Feature (this is implied and doesn&#8217;t have to be explicitly defined)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this maps neatly to the MSI we took apart in the <a href="http://www.headspring.com/nolan/creating-windows-installers-with-the-wix-toolset-part-05/">last post</a>. In the next installment, we&#8217;ll look at the process for actually turning WiX into an MSI.</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Back in college, I stumbled across a great tool called <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>.  I used it to generate class diagrams from the source of a PHP application I was working on.  More recently, I&#8217;ve found it useful again for visualizing the <em>runtime</em> relationships between objects.  GraphViz can turn a plaintext description of relationships into a graph image.  Not &#8220;graph&#8221; as in &#8220;charts and graphs&#8221;, but &#8220;graph&#8221; as in &#8220;computer science graph&#8221;.  Nodes and edges:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/simple.png"><img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/simple.png" alt="simple" width="179" height="251" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6425" /></a></p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ll see how to easily generate images like this.  Along the way, we&#8217;ll see an interesting use case for anonymous objects.</p>
<h2>The Dot File Format</h2>
<p>The image above can be generated from the following text file, using a GraphViz tool called dot.exe.  Note the use of the word &#8216;digraph&#8217;.  A graph is anything made up of nodes and edges; a digraph is a graph where the edges have <em>di</em>rection from a source node to a destination node.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014220.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>To create the image from the dot file, run the command: <code>dot.exe Simple.dot -Tpng -o Simple.png</code>.</p>
<p>The dot file format supports a lot of options.  For instance, we can customize the original dot file like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014224.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Optional attributes appear in square brackets.  Here, we give one of our edges a label, alter the colors, and change one of the nodes from an ellipse to a box:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fancy.png"><img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fancy.png" alt="fancy" width="179" height="275" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6424" /></a></p>
<p>One can imagine generating these dot files programmatically with a StringBuilder.  Doing so would be a little monotonous, especially when the optional attributes like shapes and colors are included.  You have to busy yourself with the dot format&#8217;s quoting rules as well as C#&#8217;s quoting rules.  Even when you succeed, you&#8217;ll be left with some ugly code.  I&#8217;d much rather generate the above two dot files like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014233.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014237.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Implementing the Digraph Class</h2>
<p>First, it&#8217;ll be handy to define an extension method to apply the dot quoting rules to any .NET value.  The double-quote character is special in dot files and must be preceded with a slash.  Of course, double-quotes and slashes are also meaningful in C# strings, so we have to double-escape these in the substitution:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014242.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Next, take a look at the way the optional parameters were supplied in the earlier code sample: <code>new { label = 1, color="red" }</code>.  This is an anonymous object.  It creates an instance of a class whose name we never see, with read-only properties named &#8220;label&#8221; and &#8220;color&#8221;.  We pass this to a method that doesn&#8217;t know what type is being passed to it, but that&#8217;s OK because we can use reflection to inspect such an object.  Here&#8217;s a helper that can look at these anonymous objects and turn them into an equivalent dictionary, whose ToString produces the dot syntax for attributes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014245.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> have instead provided a real named class with all the possible dot properties already defined.  Doing so would be useful as it would give the developer statement completion suggestions, but the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html">dot file format is actually quite extensive</a>.  In this case, it&#8217;s a very reasonable tradeoff to use anonymous objects and reflection for these node and edge attributes.  Even with statement completion, you&#8217;d find yourself frequently looking up details in the documentation anyway, so the return on investment would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>We can represent a single node in the graph like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014249.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>An Edge is defined by the two Nodes it connects:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014253.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Armed with all of the above classes, we can finally implement the Digraph class with ease:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5014257.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Criticism</h2>
<p>Since the scope of this sample program is <em>entirely</em> devoted to generating the dot file format, I don&#8217;t mind the fact that I mixed state (node and edge definitions) with presentation (string formatting in each ToString override).  An earlier implementation put all of the string formatting in the Digraph class, but it was fairly ugly.  If the requirements expanded such that we needed to use the node/edge structure for things in addition to presentation in dot format, I would want to move all string formatting out of the Node, Edge, and Digraph classes, having a dedicated class just for traversing a Digraph to produce a dot file.</p>

</address>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This post discusses what an MSI is, We&#8217;ll use a Microsoft SDK tool called Orca to examine what the internal structure looks like.  We&#8217;ll also talk about how the internal structure maps to Windows Installer concepts.  While this post is not about WiX directly, authoring in WiX requires a good understanding of these internal structures and how they interconnect.</p>
<h2>The Contents of an MSI</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve installed several software applications like Office or Halo on your computer, chances are you&#8217;ve come across a file with type of MSI.  MSI stands for Microsoft Installer, and is the primary package type that Windows Installer consumes to install a product.</p>
<p>There are other file types used by Windows Installer, but MSI is the only &#8220;required&#8221; type for making an installer.  I&#8217;m not going to discuss the other types, but you can find out more about them <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa372842.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>For our dissection we&#8217;re going to use an MSI that installs a single file - HelloWorld.exe.  Here&#8217;s the installer:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/msi.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="msi" alt="msi" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/msi_thumb.png" width="244" height="83" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The installer has no user interface.  This is what happens when you double click the MSI to install it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installing.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="installing" alt="installing" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installing_thumb.png" width="244" height="94" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>What happens next is the window changes to say &#8220;Please wait while Windows configures Edgewolf HelloWorld&#8221; with a progess bar, and then performs the installation and closes.  This happens so fast I couldn&#8217;t get a screenshot of it before it disappeared.  After we run the installer, we have a new entry in Programs and Features that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/programsAndFeatures.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="programsAndFeatures" alt="programsAndFeatures" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/programsAndFeatures_thumb.png" width="244" height="58" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And we can find our installed program here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installed.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="installed" alt="installed" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installed_thumb.png" width="244" height="83" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t get much simpler then that, right?</p>
<h2>MSI Internal Structure</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting how trends in software development affect technical implementations.  For example, the programming language Java was rising to prominence around the same time the XML file format was being widely touted as THE way to store data for a variety of reasons.  As a result, Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE) relies heavily on XML files, to the point that I&#8217;ve heard jokes that enterprise Java development consists of writing one line of code and editing twenty XML files.</p>
<p>Windows Installer is no different, and its source of large inspiration is relational databases.  An msi package is, quite literally, a database file with tables and rows in it.  Here&#8217;s a partial schema diagram:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/payloadTables.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="payloadTables" alt="payloadTables" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/payloadTables_thumb.png" width="244" height="111" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Since an installer is for a single product, there&#8217;s dedicated table for that.  But a product like Microsoft Office does have multiple features such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  Large features will typically be composed of a collection of subfeatures that can be installed or not installed and still have a working feature.  Examples of subfeatures for Word would be items like spellcheck, or clipart.</p>
<p>Features and subfeatures are &#8220;above the water&#8221; concepts in the way that they are exposed directly to the person using the installer.  The user sees them and has a chance to choose what features they do or do not want.</p>
<p>Features are composed of one or more components.  Components are tangible items like files, start menu shortcuts, and registry entries.  Components are &#8220;below the water&#8221; in the sense that they aren&#8217;t meant to be exposed to users.  When you&#8217;re installing Word, you could care less that you&#8217;re getting the files winword.exe, wordcnv.dll, wordcnvpxy.cnv&#8230;.well you get the idea.  Components are linked to a directory where they are installed, and are composed of one or more files.  Because the directory link is at the component level, obviously all of the files in the component need to target the same directory.</p>
<p>Components are tied to features with a linking Feature Component table.</p>
<p>In addition to the payload tables we just looked at, an MSI also has sequence tables that instruct Windows Installer what steps to execute and in what order.  There are a number standard actions included in Windows Installer such as calculating the disk space needed to perform the installation.  It&#8217;s also possible to write your own custom actions, I plan on talking about that in a later post.</p>
<h2>Installing Orca</h2>
<p>Microsoft provides a free tool called Orca that can be used to examine an MSI file.  It isn&#8217;t part of Windows, but it&#8217;s included with the Windows 7 SDK.  You can get an ISO of the Windows 7 SDK <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8442">here</a> and the Windows 8 SDK is available <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve installed the SDK, you can find an installer for Orca in the Bin directory (something similar to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin).  Run the installer, and then you&#8217;ll have Orca in your start menu.</p>
<h2>Examining the Hello World MSI</h2>
<p>Start Orca.  Click File..Open, and open the MSI you want to load.  Here’s what you’ll see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/msiTablesInOrca.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="msiTablesInOrca" alt="msiTablesInOrca" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/msiTablesInOrca_thumb.png" width="244" height="179" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to tables, the installer stores some nonrelational information in a Summary Stream.  You can view this by clicking &#8220;View..Summary Information&#8221;.  Most of it is product related, but the target architecture (32bit or 64bit) is also stored here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/summaryStreamInOrca.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="summaryStreamInOrca" alt="summaryStreamInOrca" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/summaryStreamInOrca_thumb.png" width="229" height="244" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Looking at the feature table, we see this installer only has one feature - Complete (as in a complete install).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFeature.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableFeature" alt="tableFeature" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFeature_thumb.png" width="244" height="53" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The FeatureComponent table links one component to our feature, the component called MainExecutable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFeatureComponent.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableFeatureComponent" alt="tableFeatureComponent" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFeatureComponent_thumb.png" width="244" height="75" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Heading over to the component table, we see MainExecutable, and it targets the INSTALLDIR for the directory.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableComponent.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableComponent" alt="tableComponent" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableComponent_thumb.png" width="244" height="54" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The INSTALLDIR is going into an Edgewolf HelloWorld subdirectory under Program Files.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableDirectory.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableDirectory" alt="tableDirectory" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableDirectory_thumb.png" width="244" height="71" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>So where&#8217;s the actual exe?  In the File table, and we see its linked to the MainExecutable component.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFile.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableFile" alt="tableFile" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableFile_thumb.png" width="244" height="54" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t mention it earlier, but there&#8217;s also a Property table that&#8217;s a catch-all name value pair collection.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableProperty.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="tableProperty" alt="tableProperty" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tableProperty_thumb.png" width="244" height="170" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The sequence tables instruct Windows Installer in what steps to take to run the installer.  Recall that there are two install stages (the UI stage and the Execution stage).  There are tables for each, and looking at the pictures below we can see the difference between the two:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installUiSequence.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="installUiSequence" alt="installUiSequence" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installUiSequence_thumb.png" width="244" height="115" border="0" /></a><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installExecuteSequence.png"><img style="background-image: none; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="installExecuteSequence" alt="installExecuteSequence" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/installExecuteSequence_thumb.png" width="244" height="191" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough for this post.  Now we have a solid understanding of the basic building blocks in an installer package.  In the next post we&#8217;ll take a look at the WiX that generated this MSI.</p>

			Headspring Competes at 2013 Austin Startup Games</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Austin Startup Games were a flying success this past Saturday, February 16th at the Austin Music Hall. Headspring was proud to participate for the first time!</p>
<p>The Austin Startup Games is a one-day event in which sixteen Austin companies compete in various activities, including beer pong, ping pong, shuffleboard, foosball, pop-a-shot, darts, Connect 4, trivia and flip cup. The mechanical bull was the surprise event.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6417" alt="IMAGE_B2E4A8A6-E1D4-47B2-B540-53AA3B0AE653" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMAGE_B2E4A8A6-E1D4-47B2-B540-53AA3B0AE653-400x300.jpg" width="400" height="300" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6418" alt="IMAGE_E7ED9347-5418-44A0-B09F-55DEC43F43B8" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMAGE_E7ED9347-5418-44A0-B09F-55DEC43F43B8-400x300.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>We sported these awesome Headspring shirts. We call it &#8220;From Our Heads&#8221; because it&#8217;s an abstract mash-up of the Headspring culture. It combines what we do and tools we use (bit bucket, technology, code, the cloud, mobile apps) and the things we enjoy (bowling, the Internet, providing great customer service).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6414" alt="BDQfHQVCAAImy5p" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BDQfHQVCAAImy5p-369x300.jpeg" width="369" height="300" /></p>
<p>Each company represented a charity of its choice, and Headspring chose The Cancer Connection. (link: http://www.thecancerconnection.org/) The organization provides one-on-one mentoring and oncology and hospital support to patients. The Cancer Connection volunteers provide comfort, support and informational resources to cancer patients and their families.</p>
<p>There were very intense and close competitions, and at the end of the day, Headspring walked away victoriously with a couple of medals and a proud team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Justin P. won Bronze in Connect Four</li>
<li>Chris M. and Patrick M. won Silver in Beer Pong</li>
<li>Glenn B. and Kevin H. won Bronze in Foosball</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6415" alt="20130216_142241" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130216_142241-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6416" alt="732970388" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/732970388-225x300.jpeg" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>Total results:</p>
<ul>
<li>533 lbs (about 480 meals) of food was donated to Capital Area Food Bank</li>
<li>500-600 attendees was expected and actually had 800 attendees show up</li>
</ul>
<p>The Austin Startup Games was a great opportunity to bring out our competitive side, represent Headspring among numerous Austin companies, support The Cancer Connection and bring our team together for some fun and bonding time.</p>
