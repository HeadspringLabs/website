		<p><strong>Shirley:</strong> Tell me about the Extract-Variable refactoring.</p>
<p><strong>Albert:</strong> Let&#8217;s say I have a long expression that has become hard to read, and that I can identify a noteworthy subexpression within it.  I can &#8216;extract&#8217; that subexpression from the original by introducing a new local variable.  The variable is initialized to the subexpression, and then the larger original expression is rewritten in terms of the new variable.  Doing so can make things easier to read: the original expression is shorter, and we&#8217;ve given a useful name to the part we took out.  For example:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264666.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>Shirley:</strong> Since we&#8217;re doing this extra step with an extra variable, will the result run a little slower than the original?</p>
<p><strong>Albert:</strong> No, silly!  We&#8217;re doing the same amount of work in both versions.  Even with the original version, the compiler had to break down the expression into many smaller steps just like the change we made.  We&#8217;re just introducing a useful nickname for one of those intermediate steps.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Is there any way Extract-Variable <em>could</em> make something faster?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Aren&#8217;t you listening!?  Oh, wait.  If the expression you are pulling out appears multiple times in the larger expression, and the cost of evaluating it is large enough to notice, then Extract-Variable could actually speed things up, since you&#8217;ll only evaluate it once.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> If you do that, is there any chance you&#8217;ll change the runtime behavior?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Only if the subexpression has side effects.  We used to evaluate it multiple times, and now we evaluate it once.  If the expression <em>does</em> something to the world other than just provide a value, we&#8217;d be introducing a breaking change.  That&#8217;s why you want to keep as much of your code as pure as reasonably possible.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Pure?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> An expression or function is pure if it depends only on its inputs and has no side effects.  It just looks at the inputs and returns a result.  For the same inputs, it always gives the same output.  <code>x+5</code> is pure, while <code>SendAnEmailToGrandma()</code> isn&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s safe to Extract-Variable with pure code, even when the subexpression showed up multiple times beforehand.  Pure stuff is easier to chop up, reorder, and move around.  It&#8217;s easier to reason about.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Imagine that we&#8217;ve got a large expression, and that the subexpression we&#8217;re extracting only appears <em>once</em>.  What if I told you we could <em>still</em> get a performance boost out of it?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Shirley, you&#8217;re joking.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Nope! I&#8217;ve got two situations in mind.  Let&#8217;s start with the easy one.  This loop is taking way too long to execute:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264673.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Oh, I see what you&#8217;re getting at.  We saw earlier how you can get a performance boost when extracting a subexpression that appeared multiple times in the original expression.  In this loop, we&#8217;ve got the same problem in a different format.  The subexpression <em>appears</em> once, but it gets <em>evalutated</em> a whole lot, each time with the same result.  We&#8217;d fix this with two refactorings: we&#8217;d Extract-Variable, and then we&#8217;d move that variable declaration <em>before</em> the loop:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264675.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Great! Earlier, I said I was thinking about two examples in which code with a singly-occurring subexpression could be sped up with Extract-Variable.  The easy one was the <code>foreach</code> you just fixed, but the second one&#8217;s tough.  Let&#8217;s improve upon the previous example.  Instead of building up a big list of all the values in the column, we&#8217;ll make a column object that uses a Func&lt;Row&gt; to evaluate each cell only as needed:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264677.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Again, we don&#8217;t want to keep on performing the costly CompileUserExpression(&#8230;) call every time we need to display a grid cell.  The problem is, if I Extract-Variable here, we&#8217;re left with the same wasteful recompilation:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264685.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> If the lambda gets called a bajillion times, how many times will we evaluate the costly part?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A bajillion.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Hmmph.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> How is this any different from the <code>foreach</code> example?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> When the costly bit was in a <code>foreach</code>, we could just move the variable to the outer scope.  Here, we have a lambda.</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Doesn&#8217;t a lambda introduce a scope too?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Well, yeah, but if we move <code>compiledExpression</code> outside of the lambda, wouldn&#8217;t it become available for garbage collection as soon as we returned from <code>CreateCalculatedColumn</code>?  Let&#8217;s see:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4264688.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It works!  Our lambda is referring to a variable in the surrounding scope, and we&#8217;re returning the lambda.  Lambdas are just objects, so this is just like returning any other object that references a locally-constructed thing.  The garbage collector only cleans up unreachable things, and <code>compiledExpression</code> will be reachable for as long as the lambda is reachable.  We get to avoid all that rework no matter how many times the lambda is called!</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Slick.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> How does one end a Socratic Dialogue?</p>
<p><strong>S:</strong> How about with a summary?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Extract-Variable starts out as a simple refactoring to improve the readability of large expressions.  When working with pure code, the change is both safe and easy to perform.  In addition to aiding readability, Extract-Variable can occasionally improve performance, when the extraction keeps us from doing a lot of excess work.  After extracting a variable, we can consider moving it to an outer scope, so long as doing so preserves behavior.  Moving it outside of a loop can prevent wasteful reevaluation across many iterations.  Likewise, moving it outside of a lambda can prevent wasteful reevaluation across many invocations of the lambda.</p>

			The Solution Is Never Inheritance</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>That&#8217;s how fellow-Headspringer <a href="https://twitter.com/scichelli">Sharon Cichelli</a> started a conversation today:  &#8220;The solution is never inheritance.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a controversial title.  Afterall, one must never, <em><strong>under any circumstances</strong></em> speak in absolutes.  &#8220;The maintainable solution is quite oft not inheritance&#8221; may be closer to the truth while missing the point entirely.  Judicious use of inheritance in small chunks can be useful, but implementation inheritance in the wild is usually a mess that gets out of hand quickly.</p>
<p>The general advice to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=composition+over+inheritance">favor composition over inheritance</a> has been written about countless times.  In <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/spaghetti-alla-code/">Spaghetti alla Code</a>, I blamed the problem on the way that <code>virtual/override/base</code> keywords achieve code reuse at the cost of littering your implementation with subtle <code>goto</code>-like complexity: you have to execute every line of a class hierarchy in your head in order to know what any one class is actually going to do.  When favoring composition, you&#8217;re more likely to understand what a class does by just reading that class.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t always use implementation inheritance, but when I do, I use the Template Method Pattern and the Bucket of Small-Scope Helper Methods Pattern.</p>
<h2>The Template Method Pattern</h2>
<p>In this pattern, an abstract base class provides a basic algorithm, leaving a detail or two undefined as abstract methods.  A single-level of child classes completes the story by providing implementations for the undefined steps.    I never decide up front to use this pattern.  Rather, I refactor toward it when it&#8217;s the clearest way to remove some code duplication.</p>
<h2>The Bucket of Small-Scope Helper Methods Pattern</h2>
<p>Sure, this isn&#8217;t an official Gang of Four pattern, but it comes up often enough that it deserves a name.  I arrive at this kind of inheritance incrementally.  If I have an <em>interface</em> whose implementations take on suspiciously-similar private helper methods, and the duplication mounts up, I promote the interface to an abstract class and move the common private methods up to the base class.</p>
<p>When the scope of these helper methods is very small, the base class is an appropriate home for them, but watch out: you may be hiding a new concept here that would be more useful to the rest of your system as a separate public class.</p>
<p>I use the BoSSHM Pattern when the thought of a new public class feels like overkill or overengineering.  I don&#8217;t want to distract the reader with rarely-used classes, just for the sake of having <em>small</em> classes.</p>
<h2>Evolve Towards Inheritance</h2>
<p>Off the top of my head, I can&#8217;t think of any other time I use implementation inheritance and later think to myself, &#8220;That was a good idea!&#8221;  Also, the way I arrive at these patterns is just as important as the result: rather than being the product of up-front design, I arrive at them in small steps as code duplication pains present themselves.  Each solves <em>small</em> kinds of code duplication problems, so the resulting inheritance hierarchies are also small and therefore easy to understand.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Wayne Denier</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A native of Frederick, MD, Wayne has lived in Austin for two years and we welcome him to the Headspring team! At Headspring, Wayne focuses on the user interface and general feature coding. He previously worked at Dell Inc. and Enforme Interactive. Wayne is passionate about game development and design and is experienced in HTML, Javascript, CSS, JQuery, C# and .NET MVC.</p>
<p>We are thrilled that Wayne has become part of our Headspring family! Keep reading to learn more about Wayne.</p>
<p><strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-6262 alignright" title="waynephoto" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/waynephoto-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>What made you want to work here?</strong></p>
<p>I like working with people that get excited about what they are doing, and I believe that passion leads to pushing the boundaries of what is possible. I see a lot of that passion in the team at Headspring. Anyone who has worked with or for the company has a great standard for technical excellence, an attitude of sharing and learning, and they are passionate about their discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to clients, I like providing solutions that make complex problems seem easy. I like to make tools for people to remove frustrations in the little things they have to do to perform their jobs and enjoy building software for someone to help achieve that goal.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>Communicating with people. I come from roots in graphic design and enjoy conveying ideas to people. Naturally, designing for the web became a necessity and so a few Wrox books later I was well into the world of developing software for the web. Also, programming is fun!</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>A lot. It’s fun to plan out a frame of time and present a topic to a room of people. I like setting the pacing and revealing information to people in a way that can both get them excited and present them with practical knowledge. Mentoring is another great avenue for that. I try very hard to mentor others, as well as find someone to learn from myself. The philosophy of experiential education emphasizes the pattern “see one, do one, teach one”, and I try to keep that active as much as I can.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>Anytime something is produced, learned, improved or passion is rekindled. Shipping viable software or improving it based on features that are in use is an obvious good use of time.</p>

			The Cobra Effect</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Imagine for a moment that you are a member of the government in colonial India during the period of British rule.  You&#8217;re concerned about the population of venomous cobras, so you attempt to impose a solution.  You offer a reward to anyone who brings you a dead cobra.  After a while, though, you start to get suspicious of some of the cobra hunters.  They seem to be bringing in far more cobras that any single person is likely to encounter, let alone trap and kill.  You discover that some individuals have begun raising cobras in order to turn a profit!  Clearly, your plan isn&#8217;t working, so you stop offering the bounty.  Countless cobra farmers&#8217; snakes become worthless, so they are released into the wild, increasing the population of cobras.</p>
<p>You meant well, but your attempt to impose a solution to the problem actually made things worse.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect">Cobra Effect</a> is similar to the more frequently-referenced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy&#8217;s Law</a>.  Murphy&#8217;s a bit of a pessimist: if something can go wrong, it will, as if the universe is out to get you.  The Cobra Effect, on the other hand, has more to do with human nature: you see a problem and attempt to impose a solution on a group of people, and their natural reaction to your solution ends up making the original problem worse.</p>
<p>Cobra Effect problems have 4 parts: a) recognizing a problem, b) imposing a solution on a group of people, c) people react naturally <em>to the solution</em>, and d) in turn that reaction makes the problem worse.  Years ago, I experienced these 4 stages on a software project.</p>
<h2>Farming Venomous Comments</h2>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Reading other people&#8217;s code can be frustrating when it doesn&#8217;t communicate enough of the intent.  You may not feel tempted to add lots of comments to your own code, but sometimes when looking at something ugly or unfamiliar, you find yourself wishing the other developers <em>were</em> writing lots of informative comments.  The more experienced developers on the team naturally fear the ocean of undocumented code that the rest of the team is sure to write in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>Imposing a solution:</strong> We need to ensure everyone is writing documented code, therefore commits will not pass code review unless each method has complete <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288481(v=vs.71).aspx">XML documentation comments</a>.  Each method will tell you what it is, what each of its arguments is, and what the returned value is.  The user of your code will see this information as they type via IntelliSense.</p>
<p><strong>People react naturally to the solution:</strong> It <em>hurts</em> to write those XML comments.  They are verbose, they are usually redundant, they are time consuming, and they are usually redundant.  If your product is a library to be used by other developers, you owe it to them to document the non-obvious details of your public interface, but beyond that writing these comments is absolutely painful.  Enter <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/46A20578-F0D5-4B1E-B55D-F001A6345748">GhostDoc</a>, a Visual Studio extension that writes these comments for you by inspecting the names and types of your methods and parameters.  You start with an undocumented method like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4159059.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>You place your cursor on the first line, hit a keyboard shortcut, and it automatically turns into this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4159061.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Code Review Accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>That reaction makes the problem worse:</strong> GhostDoc was <em>encouraged</em> because meeting the code review requirement <em>hurt</em> so much.  Every time I used it, a sarcastic little voice in the back of my head said &#8220;Oh, is <em>that</em> what a customerId is?&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, is <em>that</em> what that method does?&#8221;  That voice started getting louder and I soon started to block out all XML comments whenever I read through anybody&#8217;s code.  It wasn&#8217;t even a conscious decision: my eyes started scanning right by the comments as if they were whitespace.  <em>When I actually needed one of these comments to communicate something real about my intent, nobody would ever notice it; it was a an intent-needle in an angle-bracket-haystack.</em></p>
<p>Compare that last sentence to the original problem: &#8220;Reading other people&#8217;s code can be frustrating when it doesn&#8217;t communicate enough of the intent.&#8221;  The imposed solution made that problem <em>worse</em> by making it even harder to see important information about intent when the need actually arose, and it made it harder to see the intent that was already present in the code itself because you could only fit a few real lines of code on the screen at a time.  </p>
<h2>People Smells</h2>
<p>We talk about &#8220;code smells&#8221;, simple things we see in a snippet of code that give us a negative gut reaction, suggesting a deeper problem.  There are also &#8220;people smells&#8221;, where a solution to a human problem should give us a similar negative gut reaction.  With the notable exception of dubstep fans, people naturally try to avoid pain.  We seek out the path of least resistence.  When the solution to a human problem hurts more than the problem, you may get exactly what you asked for.</p>

			Take a DIP to Get DRY</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The DRY principle is pretty simple.  Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself.  When you find yourself reaching for the copy/paste commands, you&#8217;re probably creating some technical debt.  If you copy/paste a method or class from one part of your application to another with the intent to make a small change in the copy, there&#8217;s a very big chance that those two implementations will begin to drift.  Maybe a bug needs to be fixed in both, but the developer performing the fix doesn&#8217;t know that the copy took place: they&#8217;ll fix some occurrences of the bug but allow others to continue.  Even when you know about both copies, you may find yourself doing double the work each time you need to make a change to one of them.  It&#8217;s costly in development time, brain cycles, and QA time.</p>
<p>Strangely, I find that when the technical debt brought on by a DRY violation is <em>particularly</em> bad, the solution involves deliberately causing yet more duplication in the short term.  Sometimes, you need to take a DIP to get DRY.</p>
<h2>A DRY Violation in the Wild</h2>
<p>I was faced with a large DRY violation this week.  Earlier in the history of this project, a class was written in the UI layer to perform some relatively complex validation to ensure the user properly filled out a set of options.  The validation rules weren&#8217;t rocket science, but they also weren&#8217;t trivial rules like &#8216;Field A is required&#8217; or &#8216;Field B cannot exceed 20 characters&#8217;.  All told, it was about 150 lines of logic split out over about 10 methods.  Eventually, the same rules needed to be applied in a related EXE that has no UI, and at that point in time the logic was copied, pasted into an assembly that the other EXE had access to, and tweaked slightly to fit in its new home.  Naturally, the problem got worse since then, as both versions drifted away from each other.</p>
<p>Once this problem was discovered, I was tasked with resolving the duplication by phasing out the deprecated UI implementation.  The new UI would defer to the newer implementation, so both EXEs would share the same code.  Because of the drift, it wasn&#8217;t clear whether doing this the quick-and-dirty way would be remotely safe: there was a good chance the new implementation was missing important rules enforced in the UI version.  Viewing a diff between the two files wasn&#8217;t helpful, as so much had been tweaked, renamed, and refactored on both sides.  You could tell they were effectively doing the same thing, but the details were too difficult to discern all at once.</p>
<h2>Duplicate It Purposely</h2>
<p>When faced with this kind of DRY violation, my first step is to make the situation more clear by <em>deliberately introducing even more blatant duplication</em>.  I Duplicate It Purposely (DIP).  I start with a diff between the two files, and identify the low-hanging fruit: code that is only superficially different due to things like variable and method renames.  I start by making superficial changes to the deprecated code, making it look more and more like the version I want to keep around.  The workflow might look like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>View a diff.  Rename variable.  Rename variable.  Rename method.  Commit.</li>
<li>View a diff.  Rename method.  Extract method.  Reorder members. Commit.</li>
<li>View a diff.  Inline method.  Extract variable.  Commit.</li>
<li>View a diff&#8230;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>After these quick, low-risk, automatable refactorings are applied to the deprecated code, the diff becomes more illuminating.  You may finally see that the two implementations truly are doing the same thing, in which case it&#8217;s time to drop the original in favor of the second.  In my case, on the other hand, I got to a point where it was clear there were a few places where the logic actually did differ.  In fact, the differences highlighted a real bug in the version I had intended to <em>keep</em>, and I never would have realized that just comparing the two original files to each other.  Armed with a useful diff, I was able to alter the newer code to cover the missing scenarios.</p>
<p>At that point, I had two code files that were almost character-for-character the same.  The class names were different, but that was about it.  I could now safely drop the original and point the UI at the newer, corrected, shared version.</p>
<p>Even when fixing a small-scale DRY violation, such as refactoring two suspiciously-similar methods within a single class, I find myself doing this.  I start by making the duplication painfullly obvious by making them look as much like each other as possible.  That extreme duplication highlights the actual differences, giving useful hints as to how to best rephrase both implementations.</p>

			Migrating a Windows Install to a New Macbook</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently here at Headspring my workstation got upgraded from a PC laptop to a Macbook Pro. While I was excited about the new hardware and taking the plunge into Mac OS X (that’s the Roman numeral ten, not the 24th letter of the alphabet), I still needed to be able to run Windows and Visual Studio. This post summarizes the various options I explored, and my final setup.</p>
<h3>Multiboot or Virtual Machine?</h3>
<p>Multibooting is using a software tool that hooks your computer’s normal power on sequence and provides you a way to choose what operating system you want to load.</p>
<p>Microsoft has supported multibooting since Windows XP as way to install new versions of Windows while still keeping older versions for your legacy software that won’t work on the newer Windows version. It’s also been possible to multiboot Linux and Windows for a long time.</p>
<p>A virtual machine is software that pretends to be a computer, and runs another operating system inside of it. You can use a virtual machine to run an instance of Windows 98 while booted into Windows 7 for example.</p>
<p>The advantage to multibooting is performance - running an operating system inside a virtual machine causes it to run more slowly than it would if it was natively booted - but the disadvantage is you can only work within the one operating system you booted into.</p>
<p>Virtual machines can perform slower, but allow you to run both operating systems at the same time.</p>
<p>I’ve done multibooting with multiple versions of Windows and Linux in the past. It works well, but its amazing how much of a psychological barrier having to boot into an alternate OS to do something gets created. “I got an email response&#8230;I need to go update that spreadsheet&#8230;rats, it’s in the other OS&#8230;I really don’t want to close everything and reboot, I’ll do it later&#8230;”.</p>
<p>The new workstation is top of the line: Intel I7, 16GB memory, solid state hard disk. It would be more than capable of running Windows in a virtual machine without much overhead. Choosing a virtual machine over multibooting was a pretty easy choice.</p>
<p>There were several candidates for the virtual machine software - VMWare Fusion, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop. VirtualBox was ruled out pretty quickly as underperforming. Parallels and Fusion are fairly similar. We ended up going with Parallels.</p>
<h3>How I Migrated My Old Windows Install to Parallels</h3>
<p>I didn’t want to have to start over with a brand new install of Windows, my old setup was perfectly fine. Fortunately Parallels supports migrating Windows from your old PC to your new Mac. It took three tries before I figured out the best way to do it, so I wanted to share and hopefully save someone else the learning experience. It wasn’t painful, but did consume a fair amount of wasted setup time.</p>
<p>There are several options for doing the migration: using a special USB cable you can buy from Parallels, over the network, or copying to an external hard drive.</p>
<p>We didn’t buy the cable, so attempt number one was over the wireless network. Big mistake. It took over twenty hours to transfer, and the virtual machine wouldn’t boot afterwards. Somehow it got corrupted during the transfer.</p>
<p>Attempt number two was copying to external storage. This took about as long, and was going to take another twenty hours to pull off the drive to the Macbook.</p>
<p>Fortunately at this point a coworker intervened and told me using a network crossover would be much quicker.\</p>
<h3>What You’ll Need</h3>
<p>The new Macbooks don’t have a built in ethernet port, so you’ll need a Thunderbolt to NIC adapter for this. You’ll also need an ethernet crossover cable - this is a special cable that crosses the wires from plug to the other, allowing you to connect two computers directly as if they were both on a network. Because it’s a direct connection there’s virtually no transfer overhead at all.</p>
<h3>Performing the Transfer</h3>
<p>On your Windows machine you need to go download and install Parallels Transporter. Start Parallels Transporter. The screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5836" title="Parallels Transporter for Windows" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/parallelsTransporterWindows-300x177.png" alt="Screenshot of Parallels Transporter for Windows with three options: usb cable, network, external drive" width="300" height="177" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Mac download Parallels 8 and start it. Click File..Migrate. This will launch the migration wizard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/001-wizard.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5834" title="Parallels migration on Mac" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/001-wizard-300x252.png" alt="Screenshot of Parallels migration on Macbook" width="300" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>If you haven’t already done so, connect the crossover between the two computers. Choose Network. Choose IP Address instead. Select your Windows computer from the list. Alternately you can use ipconfig on your Windows machine to get your IP address and specify it manually if needed.</p>
<p><strong> When asked how to configure the image, choose Like a PC.</strong> You can customize the settings later, but if you choose Like a Mac, Parallels will automatically copy your Documents folder into your Home directory in Mac OS, leaving you with two copies of everything.</p>
<p>That’s it! Using a crossover took about two hours - much faster than using the wireless network or copying it to external storage. When the transfer was complete, the virtual machine started without any issues (well, almost - I had to reactivate Windows) and I didn’t have to setup (and endlessly tweak) a new install.</p>
<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>I’m still getting used to my new Mac. There’s a lot that’s different from Windows and I’m now fighting twenty years of muscle memory (I started using Windows on version 3.11 in 1993). I plan on writing a follow up post on adjusting from Windows to Mac OS sometime in the future.</p>
<p>The transition pain is more than worth it - there are a lot of advantages to using a Mac with Windows. The hardware is rock solid, fast, and very light (it’s less than half the weight of my old workstation). The Retina display is gorgeous and highly readable. Also of note is the ability to now develop for multiple platforms - I can still use Visual Studio for .NET development, but also write apps for IOS and MacOS as well. Support for platforms like Ruby and node.js are also better on Mac than Windows.</p>
