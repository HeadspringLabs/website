  <div class="entry-content"><p>A question I’m frequently asked typically goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I hear about all these new HTML tags, but I don’t have any problem with using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s like I&#8217;ve always done. Why should I care?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The questioners are referring to the new elements introduced with HTML5, including <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> (which encapsulates a part of your page containing navigation elements), <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> (think of a newspaper story, with its heading, byline, callouts, etc.), and <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/new-structural-elements-in-html5/">among others</a>. While it&#8217;s true the Web survived for many years without these new elements, there&#8217;s no reason to stand on tradition. The new elements provide a number of benefits to both Web developers and end users, and, best of all, you can start using them right away!</p>

While many successful teams and organizations credit the strength of the team effort as the reason for their success, there is no doubt great leaders also have a big impact and are a big part of the foundation for a strong team. Think about how Vince Lombardi’s coaching in the NFL or Walt Disney’s inspiration in the entertainment industry left impacting legacies and provided great guidance to their teams. Without leaders like Lombardi and Disney, the success of the Green Bay Packers and the Disney franchise would be different in the history books. Behind great companies, organizations, and teams are instrumental individuals with key leadership characteristics who can propel the results from good to great.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Custom software projects are hard. The Standish Group reported in 2009 that only 33% of software projects are successful! Ouch. There are many strategies to ensure successful delivery of custom software projects. One is strongly related to the relationship between the provider and the client and how the parties work together to respond when a problem arises. How this response is handled sets the tone for either a long-term healthy relationship or a one-time customer. A strong, positive response leads to client retention.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago, Headspring made a radically unique decision that in retrospect, unlocked our future growth.  We focused all of our efforts on <strong>keeping every single client</strong> that we get. In order to achieve this, it was imperative for us to start by doing the following two things:</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For about half a year, I&#8217;ve been using git for personal projects.  My use case, though, has been atypical and simplistic: a single user committing locally, treating GitHub as little more than a backup.  It suited my needs to date, and at least it exposed me to a few of the advantages of git over subversion, but I knew I was missing out on a lot of the power available.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m working on a project that uses TFS for source control.  We are <del>mitigating</del> supplementing TFS with <a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs">git-tfs</a>, a tool that allows you to work with git locally and then push your finished feature branches up to TFS.  Again, that&#8217;s a little atypical and a little limited compared to a git-only project, but it&#8217;s exposed me to a lot more of the concepts and commands that I have been missing out on.<br />

And when he is not plugging away on a computer, he can be designing and building furniture, or enjoying the company of his two brilliant daughters.</p>
<p>Basically, getting to know Steve meant getting to know how diverse his background truly is, and his desire to really involve himself in the world that surrounds him.  Here is some of what we talked about:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You have probably, at least once, ended an email with this statement:</p>
<p>“If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.”</p>
<p>How effective has this attempt at quarrying feedback ever been for you? My guess is that this sentiment probably does not move far pass pleasantries. It’s nice. It’s open. But is it really welcoming?</p>
<p>In account management, honest and timely feedback is of utmost importance. This is the case not only to achieve project goals but also to secure long-lasting relationships. Selling to existing accounts is often characterized as “low–hanging fruit,” but reality speaks much differently. Twenty-four percent of custom software projects are cancelled before completion or never used. I can only imagine how a healthy dose of careful account management in these cases could have changed the failed outcome. Client retention is actually very hard work and depends on the careful attention paid to feedback given to a trustworthy account manager.</div>

In this post we will go the next logical step and add them to the context menu, so when you right-click on a file in the solution explorer (or other places) you’re tools are right there for use.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following along, you’ll have noticed that customizing Visual Studio in these ways is a bit cumbersome. Creating context menus are no better considering there are a ton of <em>different</em> menus depending on the <em>context</em> that you’ll have to independently configure.</p>

<p>When I was in the 7th grade, one of the other students made a Myst clone with Hypercard using photos taken around the school.  That seemed like <em>pure magic</em>, so I wanted to find out how software is made.  Like most people who get into this subject at an early age, my goal was to make games.</p>
