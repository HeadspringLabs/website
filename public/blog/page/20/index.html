</ol>
<p>The act of &#8220;complecting&#8221; two things is to intertwine or braid them together in such a way that creates complexity.  Most incidental complexity in our code comes from getting separate concepts twisted up in ways that make things more complex without moving us any closer to our goals.  Sometimes we intertwine concepts so tightly that we don&#8217;t even realize it&#8217;s happened.  In this post, we&#8217;ll see how I finally untied a code knot that has been staring at me for about two years.</p>
<h2>A Quick Review</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/identifying-incidental-complexity/">A few weeks ago</a>, we saw some improvements made to the TypeChecker class.  This class traverses a tree representing all the source code input to the compiler.  If the input source code has an if-expression, then the tree will contain a node (an instance of the <code>If</code> class) that describes what the raw source code looked like.  As TypeChecker traverses the tree, it attempts to find an appropriate type for each node.  Since Rook&#8217;s if-expressions behave like C#&#8217;s <code>?:</code> ternary operator, the type of an <code>If</code> is the type of the positive and negative branch expressions.</p>
<p>In that post, the original implementation for if-expression type checking looked like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3151220.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This implementation used a needlessly-complex return type which motivated extra-complicated <code>return</code> statements.  That return type <em>complected</em> success (a new tree node with a meaningful Type property) with failure (a list of CompilerError messages to propagate up the tree).  Braiding those two ideas led to some verbose sanity checks after each step the method performed, and led to some verbose error-message-propagation in each <code>return</code> statement.</p>
<p>I improved this situation by untying these ideas.  TypeChecker started tracking a single growing list of error messages encountered so far, so that returned objects in the tree traversal methods didn&#8217;t need to pass error messages back to their caller.  At this point, we started returning <code>null</code> every time the method found an error:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3154330.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Return Statements are &#8220;Extract Method&#8221; Fences</h2>
<p>Surely this change was an improvement, but it didn&#8217;t dramatically improve the health of the TypeChecker class.  TypeChecker is a beast.  The TypeCheck methods for several of the tree nodes are suspiciously similar to each other, so I started out by trying to factor out common helper methods.</p>
<p>I failed immediately every time I tried to do so.</p>
<p>The problem was that most of these methods followed the following pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do one step of the work.</li>
<li>If that step failed, return early (null).</li>
<li>Do one step of the work.</li>
<li>If that step failed, return early (null).</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ol>
<p>Methods will multiple returns are not inherently <em>bad</em>.  I usually limit myself to using multiple returns when a method starts with some initial &#8220;guard&#8221; statements: &#8220;if this call was kind of pointless, return early&#8221;.  Doing so can help to simplify the remainder of the function by clarifying assumptions up front.  Returning multiple times throughout the <em>meat</em> of a method, though, is usually a problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Each time you leave a <code>return</code> statement in the body of a longish method, you are really installing a fence.  You aren&#8217;t going to be able to successfully apply an &#8220;Extract Method&#8221; refactoring <em>across</em> those fence boundaries (try it!), so your method will always be longish with respect to the number of fences.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These fences have kept the TypeCheck methods too longish for about 2 years.  I tried to find ways around this countless times, always resulting in something even more complex than I started with.</p>
<h2>Still Complecting Failure with Success</h2>
<p>Even after the previous improvement to the meaning of returned objects from these methods, I was still complecting success (non-null return) with failure (null return).  Sure, the error-message-collecting code was out of the way now, but I still had to inspect the result of each call to a <code>TypeCheck</code> method.  In the <code>If</code>-expression example above, I couldn&#8217;t trust the returned objects from the three calls to other <code>TypeCheck</code> methods.  I would call it, inspect the result, and then use that to decide whether I should propagate failure by returning null early.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.  What if we could just keep on going if we ran into trouble during the other <code>TypeCheck</code> calls?  Compiler errors aren&#8217;t exceptions: you don&#8217;t want to just stop looking for errors when you encounter a single problem.  By returning early, I wasn&#8217;t just making the code more complex.  I was actually limiting the amount of useful output I was ultimately reporting to the user.  Imagine how annoying it would be if the C# compiler just discarded every other error message it could have reported to you!</p>
<h2>Non-null Nulls</h2>
<p>Just removing the early return statements wouldn&#8217;t be enough, of course.  By continuing the process with nulls in play, I&#8217;d immediately start running into <code>NullReferenceException</code>s.</p>
<p>Even though the methods weren&#8217;t returning nulls themselves anymore, the <code>Type</code> property on the returned objects could still be null.  Before type checking, every node in the tree had a Type property initialized to null, meaning a type hadn&#8217;t been found for the node yet.  Some of the methods in the type checker had to inspect those Type properties in order to make decisions, and nulls would start to become a problem at runtime.</p>
<p>To resolve this, I had to apply the Null Object pattern before I could actually remove the early return statements.  With this pattern, you introduce a class that represents the simplest, most-null-like version of a type as possible.  In this case, I needed something that implemented my <code>DataType</code> abstract class while being completely uninteresting on its own.  Instances of this new <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook/commit/52686db2b801f414c932f92e390f44ab68c7040b"><code>UnknownType</code></a> class could then be liberally sprinkled over the whole tree prior to type checking.  As the new and improved type checker encountered errors, it could safely proceed to find yet more errors knowing full well that in the worst case it would be working with <code>UnknownType</code> instead of nulls.</p>
<blockquote><p>Using the Null Object pattern, I could safely remove the problematic early-return statements.  The type checker now finds all the errors it can, and our return values no longer complect success with failure.</p></blockquote>
<p>The many <code>TypeCheck</code> methods are now much shorter, easier to read, and lack the fences that would stand in the way of further refactorings.</p>

<h2>Detect, Reflect, Decomplect</h2>
<p>When you find yourself looking at suspiciously-complex code,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Detect</strong> whether you have two or more ideas all tied up and twisted together.</li>
<li><strong>Reflect</strong> on what a successful untwisting would look like.  Where will each idea live once they are separated?  Will you lose functionality in the process?  Will you gain some functionality that has been hindered by the complexity?  Will this effort open the door to further cleanup?</li>
<li><strong>Decomplect</strong> the hell out of that mess and bask in the glory of your cleaner codebase.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assumed Disaster, Assumed Success</h2>
<p>My younger brother will be starting on a PhD in San Diego this fall, and we were recently talking about the drive he&#8217;ll be taking from Austin.  Wearing the Overprotective Sibling Hat, I was asking about his contingency plans should something go wrong: &#8220;If your vehicle breaks down, who are you planning to call for help?&#8221; and the like.  I could tell I was starting to annoy, so I said &#8220;Oh, sorry, that&#8217;s the software guy talking.  Something can always go wrong.&#8221;  In response, he said, &#8220;Well I&#8217;m a mathematician.  Everything is always perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>What did I mean by &#8220;Something can always go wrong&#8221;?  Even the smallest decisions a programmer makes can have far-reaching consequences, making a system more complex than it needs to be and opening the door for bugs.  This week, we&#8217;ll see how &#8220;Primitive Obsession&#8221; affected a very small decision in my compiler, and that poor decision spread like a weed.  It caused me to write awkward methods across a class hierarchy, forced me to pass around more objects from one function call to the next when doing so shouldn&#8217;t have been necessary, and opened the door to what would have been <strong>extremely</strong> troublesome bugs.</p>
<h2>Primitive Obsession</h2>
<p><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrimitiveObsession">Primitive Obsession</a> is when you focus too much on simple data types like ints, bools, and strings when it would be more helpful and communicative to use classes composed of those simpler types.</p>
<p>For instance, I once worked on a system that dealt with phone numbers, and for a long time we just passed phone numbers around as strings.  The downside was that most functions receiving these strings had to be paranoid that they were being passed a string that wasn&#8217;t really a phone number, like &#8220;&#8221;, &#8220;Dr. Martin Van Nostrand&#8221;, or &#8220;555-0100&#8221; (which looks like a phone number but is reserved for TV).</p>
<p>Suspicious of incoming phone number strings, most functions would start by sanity checking the input by calling one of several static validation functions.  It was annoying, bug prone, and inflated the size of the code.</p>
<p>After introducing a smarter PhoneNumber class, we had less to worry about: validating and parsing a string was the only way to get an instance, so if you were passed one of these you could assume that it was already usable.  Even better, lots of those free-floating static string-twiddling methods now had a new home.</p>
<h2>Type Variables</h2>
<p>In my compiler, I over-ephasized the importance of a simple int, and that obsession led to some problems.  Before we get to that, though, we should talk a little about Type Variables.</p>
<p>When a compiler is type-checking your code, it often has to reason about the type of an expression for which there is not yet enough information.  When type checking an &#8216;if&#8217; condition, we know that the condition&#8217;s type had better be boolean, but at the moment we are inspecting the if statement there might not be enough information about the types of variables appearing in that condition.  Maybe the condition refers to a lambda expression parameter, and we won&#8217;t be able to nail down the type of that parameter until we <em>later</em> discover the <code>Func</code> type of the lambda as a whole.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the compiler has to start reasoning about types it doesn&#8217;t know about yet, it has to introduce a temporary placeholder: a stand-in for the real type that we will eventually nail down to something concrete.  We (unfortunately) call these Type Variables.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get type variables confused with generics, because there&#8217;s a definite overlap.  Consider a generic method in C#:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3327067.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>When a compiler makes its first pass through this code, it can store the definition of Echo using a type variable everywhere we see a <code>T</code> to mean &#8220;Echo does stuff with some type but we don&#8217;t know what that type is yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>An important quality of these <em>generic type variables</em> is that every time we call Echo, we need to nail down the type of <code>T</code> all over again.  A first call to Echo(1) nails down the type variable to int, and a subsequent call to Echo(&#8220;Hello!&#8221;) nails down the type variable to string.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t, however, conclude that type variables are synonymous with generic type parameters like <code>T</code> above.  There are lots of reasons a compiler won&#8217;t yet know about a type; these placeholders are not limited to explicitly-declared generic type parameter like Echo&#8217;s <code>T</code>.  Some of these type variables are <em>nongeneric</em>, meaning their behavior is a little different from the Echo example.  With Echo, we got to rediscover the concrete type with each call.  When we&#8217;re not dealing with generics, though, we can only nail things down <em>once</em>.</p>
<p>This is pretty complicated.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are only a few details of this discussion that are necessary to understand the rest of this post:</p>
<ol>
<li>A compiler needs to reason about types before it has enough information to know exactly what the type of an expression really is.</li>
<li>In these cases it generates a temporary placeholder for a type, called a Type Variable.</li>
<li>Eventually we gather clues to nail down each Type Variable to something specific like bool, string, Customer, …</li>
<li>Some type variables behave like familiar generics, and some are <em>special</em> with their own behavior.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Obsessing Over Integers</h2>
<p>Very early in development of my type checker, I was guilty of Primitive Obsession.  I needed a TypeVariable class that implemented my DataType interface so they could be used alongside concrete types like Integer, Boolean, and the like.  Similar to a .NET Guid, I needed to simply generate <em>some new unique thing</em> that wouldn&#8217;t be considered equal to the ones generated before.</p>
<p>I implemented TypeVariable as a trivial wrapper around an int, and made it so that each time you created a new one it would use a unique int that hadn&#8217;t been used yet.  The first time you needed a placeholder for a type, it would be Unknown Type #0, the second would be Unknown Type #1, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought I was avoiding Primitive Obsession by wrapping this int in a meaningfully-named class that took part in my domain.  However, my mistake was that I <em>continued to think of these things as glorified ints</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because I always thought of them as a primitive type, it never occurred to me that I might want to put more information or behavior in that class.  When my code started to care about the distinction between <em>generic</em> and <em>nongeneric</em> type variables hinted at above, <em>I couldn&#8217;t see that that concept belonged in the TypeVariable class</em> and instead I threw that concept around wherever I could to get the system to work.</p>
<p>The generic/nongeneric distinction wound up in the Scope classes that I&#8217;ve been discussing here the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Scope is <em>supposed</em> to be a dictionary-like type that stores the declared type of identifiers in scope.  If the code being compiled has a local <code>int x</code> varaible and a global <code>Echo</code> function, this dictionary-like thing would have a key &#8220;x&#8221; with value &#8220;int&#8221; and a key &#8220;Echo&#8221; with value &#8220;Func&lt;T, T&gt;&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all Scope was supposed to be, but it also took on the responsibility of knowing which TypeVariable instances were generic and which ones weren&#8217;t.  <strong>Wat.</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the troubled version looked like.  Note especially the LambdaScope class, which took on the awkward responsibility of remembering which TypeVariables were <em>special</em>:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3327028.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Holy cow, that is complex!  The different implementations of IsGeneric work together to make up for the fact that we couldn&#8217;t just <em>ask</em> each TypeVariable whether or not it was had generics-behavior, and that all grew from my preoccupation with these things being glorified ints.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse is that these implementations of IsGeneric only give accurate answers when you <em>happen</em> to call them correctly.  Note how GlobalScope always returns true.  If I ever called that implementation for a TypeVariable that really <em>isn&#8217;t</em> generic, I&#8217;d be working with a lie.  The compiler didn&#8217;t <em>happen</em> to rely on any liars yet, but if it ever did I&#8217;d be faced with some incomprehensible bugs.</p>
<h2>Fixing TypeVariable and Scope</h2>
<p>One simple change to the TypeVariable abstraction was all I needed to fix this mess.</p>
<p>The first commit addressed the main problem: <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook/commit/bc56fe6495d0fe56702ee825673b9ad74b56d977">TypeVariables know whether or not they are generic type variables upon construction. Scope no longer tracks or cares about whether type variables are generic.</a>  In this commit, TypeVariable gained a new IsGeneric property, all of the IsGeneric implementations were removed from Scope classes, and usages got cleaned up.  I even got to remove a unit test that in hindsight <em>asserted the horribly bug-prone behavior mentioned earlier</em>.  I was so confused by my own complexity that I was <em>asserting that it should behave dangerously</em>!</p>
<p>After this commit, I realized that the LambdaScope class was now completely pointless.  It wrapped an instance of another Scope class and all the methods now just defered to that other instance.  LambdaScope no longer added any new ideas, <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook/commit/e965b694fe9b7daa41367632be33a570365fa8f8">and could be removed</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition to all of this cleanup and simplification, I&#8217;m starting to see how TypeVariable could start to absorb some more misplaced behavior from the still-too-complex TypeChecker class.  The fact that it&#8217;s getting <em>easier</em> to start seeing what else can be improved is a sign that the last few weeks&#8217; worth of refactorings are actually starting to pay off!</p></blockquote>
<h2>Beware Primitive Obsession</h2>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen, Primitive Obsession isn&#8217;t just about focusing on simple types when your own domain objects are better.  Even when I made my ints into TypeVariables, I was still thinking in terms of trivial types.</p>
<p>When focusing too much on trivial types, we forget to place behaviors or related information in their most appropriate home.  This mistake leads us to place behavior and state <em>just about anywhere it&#8217;ll work</em>, leading to more mistakes.</p>
<blockquote><p>A tiny bit of obsession with a tiny type can grow through your project like a weed, spreading complexity to everything it touches.</p></blockquote>
<p>To resolve these problems, try to recognize that your simple types may deserve to be classes of their own.  Once you&#8217;ve given these concepts a useful name in your domain, don&#8217;t stop there!  Make these new types smarter, taking on behavior appropriate to the type so that the rest of your system doesn&#8217;t have to compensate for them.</p>

<h2>Composition Over Inheritance</h2>
<p>Last week, I took a suspiciously-growing class, Scope, and used subclassing to split it into a class hierarchy.  The goal was to start separating some of the concepts that had gotten all mixed up, and to better-communicate how each <em>kind</em> of Scope was to be used.  I ended that post with some vague criticism about disliking the use of &#8216;virtual&#8217;, &#8216;override&#8217;, and &#8216;base&#8217; keywords.  I felt that using subclassing was a useful tool to help separate responsibilities, but the result was more complex than necessary.</p>
<p>These keywords helped me to avoid copy/pasting code across all the subclasses, and allowed subclasses to customize that behavior where appropriate, so how bad could they be?  It all worked, and I didn&#8217;t have to reach for my copy/paste shortcuts.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook/blob/8155326c6c428cdd2bf63e9e4986796a8a20fac7/src/Rook.Compiling/Scope.cs">The code</a>&#8217;s a little hard to follow, though.  The base class contains some <code>virtual</code> methods with a default implementation.  That implementation is used by GlobalScope and TypeMemberScope because that happens to be the right thing to do for those subclasses.  LocalScope <code>override</code>s them, deliberately using the <code>base</code> implementation in <em>one</em> of those <code>override</code>s and deliberately <em>avoids</em> the <code>base</code> implementation in another.  Why?  To find out, you have to run the code in your head, and in order to do that you have to start looking around at all the implementations of all the methods in the hierarchy.  </p>
<blockquote><p>With virtual/override/base, you have to understand <em>everything</em> to understand <em>anything</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>These three keywords combine to produce the same kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti code</a> as a <code>goto</code> does.  The compiler knows what you mean, but the reader doesn&#8217;t!</p>
<p>When possible, I prefer to favor composition over inheritance.  We still want to avoid copy/pasting logic around, but composing simple objects together is another way to accomplish that goal, and the results are easier to read.</p>
<h2>Applying Composition in the Scope Hierarchy</h2>
<blockquote><p>In previous weeks, we&#8217;ve improved upon incidental complexity by removing bad abstractions and splitting up abstractions that were getting too complex.  This time, we&#8217;ll improve upon incidental complexity by recognizing that one abstraction was hiding within another.</p></blockquote>
<p>The code I didn&#8217;t want to copy around appeared largely in the base class of <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook/blob/8155326c6c428cdd2bf63e9e4986796a8a20fac7/src/Rook.Compiling/Scope.cs">the troubled implementation</a>.  I had a dictionary with a particular key type and value type, representing the types of the identifiers found in a given scope (&#8220;bindings&#8221; in compiler terms), and I wanted access to the dictionary to be strict about uniqueness of keys while not throwing exceptions (programmers mistakenly create duplicate identifiers all the time, so it&#8217;s not an exceptional occurrence).</p>
<p>This special kind of dictionary deserves to be a first class citizen of my compiler.  Let&#8217;s pull it out into its own class, separate from the class hierarchy but <em>used</em> by the class hierarchy to avoid duplicated logic.</p>
<p>I extracted the new abstraction, <code>BindingDictionary</code>, from <code>Scope</code>.  The abstract base class became empty, so I converted it to an interface:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3260425.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>(On for-pay projects I follow the IFoo interface naming convention for consistency across the team.  I don&#8217;t on this project because&#8230; because&#8230; because I say so that&#8217;s why.)</p>
<p>Contrast <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook/blob/8155326c6c428cdd2bf63e9e4986796a8a20fac7/src/Rook.Compiling/Scope.cs">the previous implementation</a> with <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook/blob/59cb30404aba89cd8bc94a761e1194e79210afab/src/Rook.Compiling/Scope.cs">the new implementation</a>.  These classes make use of the new <code>BindingDictionary</code> abstraction in order to reuse that logic without inheritance and overrides.  To understand any class, you need only look at that one class.  You don&#8217;t have to run it <em>all</em> in your head to know what it&#8217;s actual behavior is going to be, because <strong>each class is satisfying the <code>Scope</code> contract on its own</strong>.  Also, I got to give more descriptive names to the member variables because the member variables are no longer shared across multiple classes with different meanings.</p>
<p>Subclassing isn&#8217;t all bad.  I find myself using the Template Method pattern, for instance.  In that case, though, I&#8217;m only overriding methods that are abstract in the base class.  When you start overriding non-abstract methods, though, you start lying to the reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This virtual method here does <em>this</em>, unless it doesn&#8217;t.  It probably doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Criticism and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Some of these classes actually got <em>bigger</em>, which can be a code smell, but in this case they are mostly one-liners, and in my mind I exclude one-liners when considering lines-of-code counts.  The world needs more one-liner methods.</p>
<p>Now that <code>Scope</code> is just an interface, it&#8217;s easier to take a quick glance at it and know that one of the methods on it is standing out like a sore thumb.  Scopes represent which identifiers are visible at some point in the code being compiled, along with their declared types; the <code>TryIncludeUniqueBinding, TryGet, and Contains</code> methods serve that abstraction.  The <code>IsGeneric</code> method doesn&#8217;t serve that concept, but lives in these classes in order to produce the right results.</p>
<p>Looks like we&#8217;ve got another poor abstraction here: a useful abstraction is missing completely, and needs to be added so that this &#8216;IsGeneric&#8217; decision, <em>whatever the heck that means</em>, can have a good home.  We&#8217;ll see what that&#8217;s all about in my next post.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Andrew West</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/andrew-west.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5681" title="andrew west" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/andrew-west-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>This week&#8217;s developer actually started last week: Andrew West, Senior Consultant.  Andrew has been riding the contract train for all kinds of companies for about 10 years.  He&#8217;s done some server side work for mobile geo-caching apps, developed a bar code app for hazardous waste tracking in the healthcare industry, worked on projects in the financial and academic worlds, and more.  Now, he&#8217;s happy to give Headspring and our clients his full attention, telling me that he intentionally steered away from other offers because he knew he wanted to work here.  Here&#8217;s more of our conversation:</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I have a lot of experience with C#, ASP.NET MVC, and relational databases, but the learning process never ends.  I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>I’m fascinated by the space industry, so it would be interesting to work with clients in that field.  I’m amazed by things like the Mars Science Laboratory mission.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>When I was 9 or 10 years old my parents gave me a toy computer.  It only had 2 kilobytes of RAM and a 16-character display, but I managed to create simple games with it.  Eventually I learned to program the Apple II, TRS-80, and IBM PC.  By the time I was in high school, I knew I wanted a career in software.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>I started out learning various dialects of BASIC.  A few years later I learned C++ and x86 assembly language.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>Teaching a room full of people can be intimidating, but it’s still a great experience if you don’t worry too much about being perfect.  I learn a lot when I’m preparing to teach.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I still like to read books in hard copy format.  Reading a technical book from cover to cover gives me a broader understanding of a new technology than reading online code examples or documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree, Andy. Hard copy books for life!  To learn more, tweet: <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewtwest">@andrewtwest</a></p>
