			Branching: Subversion vs Git</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At a previous job, I worked for a company that used Subversion for all of its projects.  This was a welcome change coming from a TFS and Visual Source Safe background.</p>
<p>We did relatively little work with branches.  For the most part, a branch was created only to represent the state we wanted to deploy to production.  In other words, everybody worked against trunk, and when we were happy with what we had we would create a branch with the version number as its name, and we would deploy from there.  If a hotfix was needed, at least we didn&#8217;t have to worry about deploying it along with incomplete features under development; we&#8217;d base the hotfix on the version branch and deploy that.</p>
<p>On one occasion, someone needed to make a fairly drastic change to the system.  It was a little risky, and would have interfered with the rest of the team if it was performed against trunk, so they made a feature branch for it.  About a month later, I was tasked with merging that back into trunk.</p>
<p><strong>This was, shall we say, an Interesting Merge.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout development of the branch, work being performed in the trunk had <em>not</em> been periodically merged into the branch, meaning that there were many, many conflicts without an obvious resolution.  Ultimately things worked out, but it didn&#8217;t seem like a great way to do things.  With my lack of exposure to alternatives, I didn&#8217;t really see the great benefit of frequent branching.</p>
<h2>Sane Branching</h2>
<p><strong>The whole concept of branching was intimidating to me because the <em>way</em> we did it caused more pain than it alleviated.</strong></p>
<p>Things have gotten better since then.  I&#8217;ve been able to experience a sane feature branching strategy with Subversion over the past year, and the pain was far outweighed by the benefits.  Throughout development of a feature branch, you periodically merge from the parent branch so that the effort of merging takes place <em>away</em> from the main line and in small doses.  When it&#8217;s time to merge the feature branch back to the parent, there&#8217;s very little risk involved because you already know that your changes work in concert with your coworkers&#8217; changes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a little frustrating with Subversion, though.  Branching and switching between branches are big and slow operations because they&#8217;re dealing with point-in-time copies of Big Honking Folders.  It&#8217;s almost a <em>coincidence</em> that Subversion is aware of the history involved.</p>
<h2>Saner Branching</h2>
<p>Git has <em>again</em> changed my mind about branching.  <strong>With Subversion, a branch is a whole new commit containing a point-in-time copy of your code.  With git, a branch is a named pointer to a commit you&#8217;ve already made.</strong>  You get a little less noise in your history because you don&#8217;t have to wade through phony commits: some Subversion commits represent real work performed, and some just represent the act of branching, which doesn&#8217;t really <em>tell</em> me something.</p>
<p>Creating a branch in git is extremely fast.  It doesn&#8217;t take long to write a commit ID to a local file, and that&#8217;s all there is to it.  Git lets all of your branches use the same workspace, and switching from one branch to another is also fast.  I find myself creating branches way more often than before.  It&#8217;s so fast and so simple compared to Subversion that speed/complexity no longer have to come into play when deciding whether or not to create one.  <strong>I&#8217;m about to start working on a new train of thought, so I branch.</strong></p>

			Headspring Shows Some Love at Knowbility&#8217;s Austin AIR</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just in time for Valentine’s Day, three Headspring consultants competed in the annual Austin Accessibility Internet Rally (Austin AIR) hosted by <a href="http://www.knowbility.org/">Knowbility.org</a>.  Knowbility&#8217;s website explains the goal of the rally is &#8220;to teach participating web developers and designers about the tools and techniques necessary to make the web accessible to everyone – including people with disabilities.&#8221;  In addition, participating nonprofits benefit by receiving professional help to build a new or replace an existing site.  Judging for the competition lasts a couple weeks, and the winner is announced at an awards ceremony in March.</p>
<p>Headspring-ers Anne Epstein, Mahendra Mavani and Deran Schilling showed up bright and early Saturday morning  to form their team, calling themselves the Headspring Hurwitzes (a tribute to our reigning Chief Architect, Kevin Hurwitz). They were assigned to Texas TERA with a mission to breathe life into their stale, outdated website.</p>
<p>Now this is a fine looking group:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Headspring-Hurwitzes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Headspring-Hurwitzes_thumb.jpg" alt="Headspring Hurwitzes" width="380" height="384" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/headspring-shows-some-love-at-knowbilitys-austin-air/headspring-hurwitzes-and-texas-tera" rel="attachment wp-att-3594"><img class="size-full wp-image-3594 aligncenter" title="Headspring Hurwitzes and Texas TERA" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Headspring-Hurwitzes-and-Texas-TERA.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="377" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team had a lot of fun and told me how happy they were about having the opportunity to participate.  “It was really a privilege to help out such an important and genuinely interesting and cool organization.  It turned out to be a lot of fun too,” said Anne Epstein.</p>
<p>Deran Schilling, who participated and and won last year’s Houston AIR event told me, “I think the best part was meeting the people that make Texas TERA successful.  They’re an amazing group of people and I was happy that we could help out.  That sounds so canned…but it’s true!”</p>
<p>Mahendra Mavani commented, &#8220;First or last, who cares about the winner now? We already won when we showed the happy faces of Texas TERA, who can now use their site on laptops, tablets, and smart phones.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Texas TERA representatives were also happy to be a part of the fun, and thanked their team for providing them with a dramatically improved site. They mentioned the biggest benefit is that now content can easily be edited by anyone on the board or staff, using any device, anywhere.</p>
<p align="left">Here’s a <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> look at what the Headspring Hurwitzes accomplished in an 8 hour window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Texas-TERA-website2.png"><img class="aligncenter" style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Texas-TERA-website_thumb2.png" alt="Texas TERA website" width="487" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>We’ll keep everyone posted as we find out more information, upcoming Austin AIR announcements and awards.  Stay tuned!</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Brandon Barry</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_5596_2.jpg"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_5596_2_thumb.jpg" alt="IMG_5596_2" width="164" height="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>From what our coworkers say, Senior Consultant Brandon Barry can go head to head with Jimmy Bogard about the internals of the .NET framework.  Recently, he wrote a library for .NET that allows for dynamic querying SQL databases using LINQ syntax, but with no configuration. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/maydaytx/DynamicLinq">Github</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, he is incredibly knowledgeable Headspring developer, and is known for his affinity for clean, elegant code.  In fact, he prefers refactoring rather than having to work around bad code.  He is also great proponent for balancing the benefit of tests without sacrificing quality.  Here’s what else I learned today:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I’m an expert in .NET.  I’m very strong with all things technical and I usually volunteer for the difficult problems.  I’m also creative (probably because I’m left-handed), which is why software development is my passion.  I’m also an expert rock bassist.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development? What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>When I was in 10th grade, I taught myself to program my TI-86 graphing calculator during math class.  I wrote programs to solve test questions so that I could just enter the inputs, and the program would show all the steps and the answer.   I also wrote a couple of simple text-based games that I let my classmates play.  Once I realized that I liked creating the game more than playing it, I was hooked.</p>
<p><strong>So what came next?</strong></p>
<p>When it was time for college I knew I wanted to major in Computer Science.  However, I  couldn’t get into the program right away because of my grades, so I started in Mechanical Engineering.  I’ve always thought that was weird. Isn’t engineering supposed to be harder?  Anyway I transferred as soon as I could into the Computer Science department.  We learned a few languages and a lot of theory, but not a lot about best practices in development.  I acquired my “skill” for development at my first job out of college in Temple at McLane Advanced Technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>I take the path of least resistance.  Sometime I follow an example.  I taught myself how to play chords on the guitar by watching my dad and brother play one day.  After they left the room, I was playing along to my first Nirvana song (<em>In Bloom</em>) in no time.  Other times I read a manual.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I gauge time well spent by how much enjoyment I get.  If you don’t enjoy what you are doing and have a passion for it, it’s really just a waste of time.</p>

			Am I Not Dead? Commit.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As I mentioned last week, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/hey-tfs-git-out-of-my-way">started using git</a> recently, specifically a git-to-tfs bridge so that I can avoid as much contact with TFS as humanly possible.</p>
<p>Most of my recent experience has been with subversion, so I have been <em>unlearning</em> that as much as I have been <em>learning</em> git.  The most apparent difference right away is what it really means to make a &quot;commit&quot;.</p>
<p>With subversion, even when working in a feature branch, my commits would be immediately shared with my coworkers.  I was basically handing a diff to my coworkers every time I checked something in.   Since anything I committed would be immediately shared, I had an extra concern at commit-time: &#8220;If I commit right now, and someone else gets latest, will I mess things up for them?&#8221;.  Despite wanting to commit as often as possible, I could only allow myself to commit when I had completed <em>the smallest chunk of work that could be shipped if I got hit by a bus</em>.  This seemed like the most reasonable rule of thumb to follow, but even these commits could end up fairly large.</p>
<p>Subversion is like a video game with sparse save points.  You play for a while, maybe even an hour or two, before reaching a point where you&#8217;re even <em>allowed</em> to save your progress.  You might even get a little lost along the way, and you can&#8217;t just jump back to the last save point without wasting all that time.</p>
<p>Working with git has felt a lot more like playing the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)">Half-Life</a>.  Maybe it was really difficult, or maybe I was just terrible at it, but I found myself being squashed or blown up every other minute.  Thankfully, instead of having to make your way to a special save point, you could just save your progress at any moment or jump back to any previous save.  <strong>Have I moved 10 feet?  Am I not dead?  Save.</strong></p>
<p>Now that I can work with a local feature branch, I can think differently about what a commit actually <em>is</em>.  If I commit far more often than I did with subversion, I harm nobody; it&#8217;s all just local anyway.  When I ultimately push up to TFS, it&#8217;ll batch up all my local commits into a single set of changes representing the before/after comparison of all of my work.  Any missteps along the way won&#8217;t show up to my coworkers, yet while <em>doing</em> the work I could always look back to retrace my own train of thought.  <strong>Have I made any forward progress, shippable or not?  Am I not dead? Commit.</strong></p>

		<a href="/blog/why-should-i-use-html5s-new-elements/">
		
			Why Should I Use HTML5&#8217;s New Elements?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question I’m frequently asked typically goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I hear about all these new HTML tags, but I don’t have any problem with using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s like I&#8217;ve always done. Why should I care?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The questioners are referring to the new elements introduced with HTML5, including <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> (which encapsulates a part of your page containing navigation elements), <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> (think of a newspaper story, with its heading, byline, callouts, etc.), and <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/new-structural-elements-in-html5/">among others</a>. While it&#8217;s true the Web survived for many years without these new elements, there&#8217;s no reason to stand on tradition. The new elements provide a number of benefits to both Web developers and end users, and, best of all, you can start using them right away!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content aggregators and search providers can better figure out your content.</strong> News aggregators and search engines are everywhere, and are often an excellent way to disseminate your published content. Why not make it easy on them by explicitly marking what parts of your page they care about and what parts they can ignore?</li>
<li><strong>Screen readers need all the help they can get.</strong> Many potential visitors require assistive devices to view the Web, but Web sites have been slow to adopt tools to help. HTML5’s new elements help out by letting screen readers know what sections of the page represent real content, and what sections are simply visual fluff.</li>
<li><strong>The new tags are there, regardless.</strong> Either natively or with easy and clever workarounds, practically all browsers in use today recognize the new elements. Plus, they&#8217;ve been standardized by a number of industry groups. It&#8217;s never been easier to simply start working with them and you can rest easy knowing the new elements are here to stay.</li>
<li><strong>Your coworkers will thank you.</strong> The new elements are far more descriptive than the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> standby is, meaning the same content is considerably more understandable to other developers looking at your HTML source. Self-explanatory semantic markup reduces confusion and is often cleaner-looking than its cousins with pervasive use of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags.</li>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re probably already using them.</strong> These elements were added to the HTML5 specification because Web designers were already using them&#8230;just in a more verbose format. Most Web sites have common sections, like a header, navigation, and footer, yet there was no way to signify this with HTML. Thanks to the new elements, instead of something like this (which used to be all over the Internet):
<pre>&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&#39;footer&#39;&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>&#8230;we now have a much more concise representation of the same concept:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>Much better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re working on a Web site for the newest, hottest start-up or helping maintain a 10-year-old internal Web site, the new HTML5 elements can provide you with a number of benefits. They&#8217;re easy to start using, respected by Web developers and search engines alike, and, soon, you’ll start to wonder how you lived without them.</p>
<p>Have you encountered other benefits of using the new HTML5 elements? Have a particularly-elegant use case for one? Let us know in the comments!</p>

			Leadership Characteristics for a Strong Team</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/?attachment_id=3488" rel="attachment wp-att-3488"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3488" title="Leader and his team" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/leadership-characteristics.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="346" /></a>From championship-winning sports teams to multi-million dollar companies, strong, cohesive and successful teams take a great amount of hard work, dedication and focus. While many successful teams and organizations credit the strength of the team effort as the reason for their success, there is no doubt great leaders also have a big impact and are a big part of the foundation for a strong team. Think about how Vince Lombardi’s coaching in the NFL or Walt Disney’s inspiration in the entertainment industry left impacting legacies and provided great guidance to their teams. Without leaders like Lombardi and Disney, the success of the Green Bay Packers and the Disney franchise would be different in the history books. Behind great companies, organizations, and teams are instrumental individuals with key leadership characteristics who can propel the results from good to great.</p>
<p>Great leaders take on a mission or goal of an organization or as entrepreneurs do, they develop one of their own. They live the mission, which many times comes from their passion of doing what they love. Clear illustrations are athletes who love the game and encourage their teammates by example on the field. Another example is Steve Jobs and his love of improving technology for people. Their passion bleeds into their actions and inevitably shows in the results.</p>
<p>Great leaders then strategize the best ways to reach their goal and guide their team on the route, which may even involve shifting the route when obstacles arise, new teammates are recruited or unavoidable circumstances come their way. Great leaders not only adapt to change but they excel through it. The risks they take may not always have the best outcomes, but they learn from their experiences to make better choices in the future.</p>
<p>Although many may argue that great leaders are born, there are clear examples in history and even at Headspring, that great leaders can be made. With changing needs in the environment, such as new problems that need solutions, a leader can be made when he/she encounters circumstances. In those situations, self-made or environment-made, a great leader excels when he/she is able to take his/her focus on the goal and guide the rest of the team to achieve the goal. Great leaders stay engaged with their team and encourage and challenge them along the way. It’s important for leaders to stay focused, accept and adapt to change when necessary and support their team the best they can.</p>
<p>Do you know any great leaders? What do you admire most about him/her?</p>

		<p>Custom software projects are hard. The Standish Group reported in 2009 that only 33% of software projects are successful! Ouch. There are many strategies to ensure successful delivery of custom software projects. One is strongly related to the relationship between the provider and the client and how the parties work together to respond when a problem arises. How this response is handled sets the tone for either a long-term healthy relationship or a one-time customer. A strong, positive response leads to client retention.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago, Headspring made a radically unique decision that in retrospect, unlocked our future growth.  We focused all of our efforts on <strong>keeping every single client</strong> that we get. In order to achieve this, it was imperative for us to start by doing the following two things:</p>
<p>1)      Find a good culture fit between our clients and us. This gives the relationship a head start and helps us be better aligned with the client’s need and goals</p>
<p>2)      Ensure our client’s needs are mapped directly to our core competencies so we are in a position to add the maximum amount of value possible.</p>
<p>We called this the “Get New, Keep Existing” strategy.  It sounds simple, but it is alarming how many companies have trouble with this and never realize that this is the key to their future growth.</p>
<p>Working only with clients to whom you can bring value is important.  It is our sales team’s responsibility to seek other companies that will gain value from our core competencies and that will be a strong culture fit for us and our core values – like honest communication and drive for excellence.  By finding clients who gain value from your core competencies, it will lead to a more transparent exchange.  Bottom line is that we must be a good fit for <strong>each other</strong>.</p>
<p>Our goal at Headspring is to pioneer the “no surprises” movement in the custom software industry. Strong communication and a win/win attitude will keep both parties from unreasonably high or incorrect expectations.  There is no sense in pushing a product or a service on a client when it doesn’t fit their needs.</p>
<p>Once the fit is established, and the work has begun, good account management is one strategy that mitigates the risk of a project failing, and increases the chance that the client will return for more services.  It establishes a strong relationship that gives clients a greater level of comfort in sharing candid feedback.  In addition, it provides a strong foundation to solve tough problems that will arise with any custom software project. I have mapped out a few techniques, like the Rule of Three, in my <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/02/account-management-taking-off-the-rosecolored-glasses">previous blog</a>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and we have seen dramatic growth, attributing a great deal of our progress to the simple “Get New, Keep Existing” approach.</p>
<p>What if you focused all of your resources and people on getting the right clients, and keeping the ones you have?</p>

			Hey TFS, Git Out of My Way!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For about half a year, I&#8217;ve been using git for personal projects.  My use case, though, has been atypical and simplistic: a single user committing locally, treating GitHub as little more than a backup.  It suited my needs to date, and at least it exposed me to a few of the advantages of git over subversion, but I knew I was missing out on a lot of the power available.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m working on a project that uses TFS for source control.  We are <del>mitigating</del> supplementing TFS with <a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs">git-tfs</a>, a tool that allows you to work with git locally and then push your finished feature branches up to TFS.  Again, that&#8217;s a little atypical and a little limited compared to a git-only project, but it&#8217;s exposed me to a lot more of the concepts and commands that I have been missing out on.</p>
<p>TFS is completely ignorant of the fact that I&#8217;m using git.  My local git repository starts out as a copy of the entire history of the TFS trunk, and I&#8217;m free to create local feature branches off of that.  I commit as much as I want to a local feature branch, and then use a git-tfs command that batches all of my local commits up into one TFS commit, complete with the TFS commit dialog.  I can avoid TFS-style merging, instead using git commands and my favorite merge tool to incorporate upstream changes into my local copy.  Jimmy Bogard has already described <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2011/09/20/git-workflows-with-git-tfs/">the git-tfs workflow</a> in detail.</p>
<p>Before this recent new project, my progress up the git learning curve was pointlessly slow.  Although there are a lot of good tutorials out there, it just wasn&#8217;t sinking in.  <strong>What made all the difference for me was to have an experienced git user sit down with me for about an hour, physically going through the motions of the workflow.</strong>  We started with the TFS clone, created and switched between branches, made some commits, submitted to TFS, and then pulled down upstream changes into our local repositories.  We set up two users to simultaneously modify the same files, and walked through a typical rebase.  All of a sudden, things started to sink in.  It&#8217;s just one of those things you have to <em>do</em> rather than <em>study</em>.</p>
<p>Along the way, we had the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/">Git Extensions</a> browser open at all times.  We&#8217;d refresh this after executing any interesting command.  It helped a lot to do so, especially when you get to the point where you can predict what the updated screen will look like in advance.  This is an exaggeration, but <strong>git is first and foremost a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a>-building tool, and only incidentally a source control tool</strong>, so seeing the graph build up with each command really helps you to unlearn the metaphors that your previous source control tool etched into your brain.</p>
<p>With that basic foundation, it&#8217;s now becoming easier to introduce myself to other commands.  If you want to put an extremely sharp tool in your tool belt, find a buddy, have a repository browser handy, and just dive in.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Steve Donie</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Steve-Donie.jpg"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Steve-Donie_thumb.jpg" alt="Steve Donie" width="164" height="244" align="right" border="0" /></a>When Steve Donie was hired as a Principal Consultant at Headspring in early 2011, he hit the ground running.  His first day on the job, he started as the project lead for EPA Systems, designing a system for tracking greenhouse gasses for a large oil and gas company.  He encompasses the solutions based approach that we covet so much at Headspring and in life.  At home, Steve and his father worked on a massive project digitizing hundreds of family photos from their original slides onto an online portal for their entire family to share.  He is also the webmaster for his local high school’s swim team. And when he is not plugging away on a computer, he can be designing and building furniture, or enjoying the company of his two brilliant daughters.</p>
<p>Basically, getting to know Steve meant getting to know how diverse his background truly is, and his desire to really involve himself in the world that surrounds him.  Here is some of what we talked about:</p>
<p><strong>What tools and technologies would you consider yourself an expert in?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been doing software development for over 20 years and have worked with a variety of different languages and technologies.  I’ve mostly worked in a Microsoft environment, starting with DOS, through Windows 3.1, through all the various intervening versions of Windows, up to the current Windows 7.  I’ve also done a fair amount of work on the GNU/Linux platform and on Mac OSX. Language-wise, I’ve mainly used C, C++, Java and C#.</p>
<p><strong>What work or studies have you done with these tools and technologies that make you feel expert in them?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve mainly worked in industry rather than in consulting.  My first job out of college was developing a screen reader for Windows 95, so I had to learn a lot about accessibility.  I then worked for Microsoft in their Accessibility and Disabilities group.  My next ‘career’ had me working for a company developing sub-surface modeling and simulation software for the oil and gas industry.  I then focused on improving my test-driven design skills and learning C# and .NET on a project handling law firm invoices.  I took another turn through the oil and gas business, honing my leadership, management, and project management skills before coming to Headspring in March 2011.</p>
<p><strong>What would you say that your team relies on you for?</strong></p>
<p>Probably my domain expertise.  Windows internals, accessibility for people with disabilities, and a lot of work for the oil and gas industry are all included.  I also have a particular passion for agile software development processes, and automating the software development lifecycle, from builds through deploys.  I have also been told that I am great at explaining things; I try to be the translator between technical and non-technical folks.</p>
<p><strong>When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></p>
<p>My first memory was that I wanted to be an architect. I watched a lot of “Brady Bunch” and thought Mike Brady was pretty cool.  Later on, I decided I wanted to be a fighter pilot, and went to the United States Air Force Academy in pursuit of that goal.  I soon learned that “Maverick” from Top Gun was not how pilots really were, and transferred to the University of Texas to pursue my second love - computers.</p>
<p><strong>How do you gauge “time well spent”?</strong></p>
<p>I am very motivated by successful results.  If something that took a lot of time does not turn out how I wanted it to, it’s harder for me to just say “oh well; I learned something.”  However, during a project, I am patient and careful based on the successful results that I am expecting.</p>
<p><strong>What do you listen to on your way to work?</strong></p>
<p>I mainly listen to the news on NPR when I drive, and podcasts when I walk my dog.  I listen to a few technical podcasts (This Developer’s life, dotNet Rocks, Software Engineering Radio) and other podcasts (RadioLab, This American Life, Planet Money) when I walk my dog.  When I listen to music I lean towards classic rock (Beatles, Stones, The Who, Grateful Dead), Reggae, and alternative/punk.</p>

			Account Management: Taking Off the Rose–Colored Glasses</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You have probably, at least once, ended an email with this statement:</p>
<p>“If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.”</p>
<p>How effective has this attempt at quarrying feedback ever been for you? My guess is that this sentiment probably does not move far pass pleasantries. It’s nice. It’s open. But is it really welcoming?</p>
<p>In account management, honest and timely feedback is of utmost importance. This is the case not only to achieve project goals but also to secure long-lasting relationships. Selling to existing accounts is often characterized as “low–hanging fruit,” but reality speaks much differently. Twenty-four percent of custom software projects are cancelled before completion or never used. I can only imagine how a healthy dose of careful account management in these cases could have changed the failed outcome. Client retention is actually very hard work and depends on the careful attention paid to feedback given to a trustworthy account manager.</p>
<p>Some clients are powerfully communicative, allowing account managers and consultants to focus on satisfying the scope of the project objectives. With these people, you don’t have to worry about whether you’ll get useful responses to your request for comments. You also don’t have to worry about if you are welcoming enough because you know it’s coming anyway.</p>
<p>One thing that keeps us from pressing for feedback is what I call “happy ears.” These conversations tend to be brief and end on a good note:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image15.png"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" width="518" height="266" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Two factors play into this scenario: The psychology of the person asking questions and the psychology of the person answering questions. The person answering seeks approval by giving praise and the person asking stops once they receive praise for a job well done. The person asking the questions has his/her happy ears on, and they don’t press for more feedback because that would be more work. The person answering the question then assumes that their feedback would be disregarded or would disrupt a good working relationship with a reliable vendor. This need for approval creates communication walls on both sides.</p>
<p>So how is it possible to garner feedback from a client that is not an effective communicator? In other words, how do I get constructive feedback from a <em>seemingly</em> <em>satisfied</em> client?</p>
<p>Some like to start with the Rule of Three: ask the same question three times, in three different ways, and get to the truth. Here’s an example of the supposed conversation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image16.png"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" width="515" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We had to ask three times, but eventually we get to the reality of our situation. Had we not pressed the issue, would we have known about these issues? The results shouldn’t be surprising to the consulting team. Account managers should be able to bring this feedback to the consulting team, and the team should have an action plan already in place to acknowledge these shortcomings. However, having an account manager available to ask the right questions and empathize with the client&#8217;s perception of the project ensures a new level of trust and respect between the client and the organization. This can turn a satisfied client into a return customer.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to place account managers on every project and stress the importance of their role. Have them hold proactive meetings, even when things are going well. Meet in person, often. Shake hands. Share a meal together. Uncover all assumptions, and get to know your client’s wants and desires on a personal level.</p>
<p>Some companies have separate departments for account management, but we utilize our sales team because they are the original point of contact.</p>
<p>Who fills the client satisfaction role in your organization? What can they do to better uncover the hidden opportunities and areas for improvement?</p>
