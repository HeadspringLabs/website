			An Underscore Templates Primer</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In April 2011, the jQuery team <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/">announced</a> development on the popular jQuery Templates plugin would be delayed indefinitely. In need of a replacement, I began investigating alternatives and soon discovered <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore</a>, the &#8220;utility belt&#8221; library behind the awesome <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> framework. The Underscore library includes an easy-to-use templating feature that easily integrates with any JSON data source, so read on to learn how easy it is to create JSON-backed templates.</p>
<p>Sending JSON data to a browser is outside the scope of this blog post, but, for reference, take a look at this collection of books:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;[
  {
    &quot;title&quot;:&quot;Myst: The Book of Atrus&quot;,
    &quot;author&quot;:&quot;Rand Miller&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Hobbit&quot;,
    &quot;author&quot;:&quot;J.R.R. Tolkien&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;title&quot;:&quot;Stardust&quot;,
    &quot;author&quot;:&quot;Neil Gaiman&quot;
  }
]
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>In this example, we&#8217;ll display this collection of books as a simple unordered list, but don&#8217;t let that stop you from experimenting!</p>
<h2>The Template</h2>
<p>First, we need to define our Underscore template, which we&#8217;ll do in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block (meaning browsers will ignore it while rendering the page, but we can still reference it by its client ID) with the type of <code>text/template</code> (so your fellow developers will know it&#8217;s a template versus a standard bit of JavaScript).</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script id=&#39;tmpl-books&#39; type=&#39;text/template&#39;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;% for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; books.length; i++) { %&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;% var book = books[i]; %&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;%= book.title %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; by &amp;lt;%= book.author %&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;% } %&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>If you&#8217;ve worked with tools like ASP.NET &#8220;WebForms&#8221; or Rails, you may recognize the &#8220;bee sting&#8221; operators (<code>&lt;%</code> and <code>%&gt;</code>), which Underscore uses to both output data to the rendered template and encapsulate behavior (as JavaScript). In this template, we first loop through the &#8220;books&#8221; collection (which we&#8217;ll define in the next section), pluck out each book as the loop progresses, and print out the<br />
title and author of each as an unordered list item.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re free to inject as much JavaScript as you wish into your templates, but I find they&#8217;re most maintainable when the script is kept to a minimum (for me, this means mostly just loops and ternary operators, like the one below).</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;% book.published ? print(&#39;(&#39; + book.published + &#39;)&#39;) : &#39;&#39; %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>(The <code>print()</code> function is a handy alternative to the <code>&lt;%= %&gt;</code> syntax for outputting values inside other functions, like we&#8217;re doing here.)</p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve defined our JSON source and the template for displaying our data, we need simply to tell Underscore to render the template and give us back the output HTML (using Underscore&#8217;s <code>template()</code> function).</p>
<p>In our example, <code>data</code> represents our JSON collection of books, but keep in mind your JSON data source may be named something different. We&#8217;ll tell Underscore to put this data inside the <code>books</code> collection, which we&#8217;ve referenced in our template.</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;// Get the template&#39;s markup...
var tmplMarkup = $(&#39;#tmpl-books&#39;).html();
// ...tell Underscore to render the template...
var compiledTmpl = _.template(tmplMarkup, { books : data });
// ...and update part of your page:
$(&#39;#target&#39;).html(compiledTmpl);
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>Underscore kindly compiles the template with our well-formed data and produces the following output, ready for injection into our HTML page:</p>
<pre>&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Myst: The Book of Atrus&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; by Rand Miller&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The Hobbit&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; by J.R.R. Tolkien&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Stardust&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; by Neil Gaiman&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
<p>Underscore&#8217;s templating feature quickly made its way onto my list of must-have tools for client-side Web development. Try your hand at a few JSON-backed templates using this versatile framework and it may appear on yours, as well.</p>

			Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 3</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In my previous posts (<a title="Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 1" href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/customizing-visual-studio-with-external-tools-part-1">part 1</a>, <a title="Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 2" href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/customizing-visual-studio-with-external-tools-part-2">part 2</a>) I showed you how to create external tools and add them to a custom tool bar. In this post we will go the next logical step and add them to the context menu, so when you right-click on a file in the solution explorer (or other places) you’re tools are right there for use.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following along, you’ll have noticed that customizing Visual Studio in these ways is a bit cumbersome. Creating context menus are no better considering there are a ton of <em>different</em> menus depending on the <em>context</em> that you’ll have to independently configure.</p>
<h2>Creating a right-click, Open in Notepad context menu</h2>
<p>Lets start with a simple example: creating a new context menu to open the selected document in Notepad++ by using the external tool we previously created to open files in Notepad++. Here’s what we’re going to create:</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image9.png" alt="Visual Studio open in notepad context menu" width="358" height="126" border="0" /></p>
<p>Go to Tools &gt; Customize, or right-click in the toolbar area and click “Customize…” to open the familiar customization dialog. Go to the “Commands” tab and select the radio button for Context menu and expand the drop down list. Brace yourself, because what you’ll see is <em>every single context menu and sub-menu</em> in Visual Studio. And herein lies the pain of creating a context menu – you have to configure it for each <em>context</em> it may need to be used in. You’ll see the menus are separated by the symbol “|” which denotes a sub-menu.</p>
<p>If you select “Project and Solution Context Menus” the “Controls:” list will show all of the context menus related to Projects and Solutions (a Project menu, Solution Folder menu, and so on). The Project menu is thus in the drop down list as “Project and Solution Context Menus | Project” and it has a controls and sub-menus itself. It’s a little confusing but once you poke around you’ll get the hang of it.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image10.png" alt="List of context menus" width="421" height="354" border="0" /></p>
<p>Above I have highlighted the “Project and Solution Context Menus | Item” menu, which is the context menu that appears when you right click a file in the solution explorer. Once this is selected, click “Add Command…” and find the external tool associated with the command you previously created in <a title="Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 1" href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/customizing-visual-studio-with-external-tools-part-1">part 1</a>. It will be in the “Tools” category. You can then click on “Modify Selection” and rename the command.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image11.png" alt="Adding commands to a context menu" width="398" height="270" border="0" /></p>
<p>A final, optional step is to create a new “group” for you command(s). Select the command just under the one you added (“Open” in this case) and click “Modify Selection” on it and the “Begin a Group” selection will be available. Click it and a group separator will be created under your command:</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image12.png" alt="Context menu command in a group" width="265" height="66" border="0" /></p>
<p>You’re done! Close out all the dialogs and right click on a file in the solution explorer and it’ll open up in Notepad++ for editing.</p>
<h2>Creating a context sub-menu</h2>
<p>You can create a sub-menu much the same way. Select the menu it belongs in and instead of adding a command, click the “Add New Menu” button. You can rename it the same way you renamed your external command above. Once renamed and placed in the order you wish, it’s time to add commands to it. Because I just added a new menu to the “Project and Solution Context Menus | Item” menu, it will now appear in the context menu drop down list, and we have to select it there in order to add commands to it:</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image13.png" alt="Creating a sub-menu within a context menu" width="370" height="92" border="0" /></p>
<p>I’ve added the Explorer and Notepad++ commands that I created in <a title="Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 1" href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/customizing-visual-studio-with-external-tools-part-1">part 1</a> in the “My Menu” I created. Now I have these commands available to files in the Solution Explorer in their own sub-menu!</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image14.png" alt="A custom context menu" width="476" height="101" border="0" /></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been writing software professionally for 9 years now, and unprofessionally for 18.  My recent focus has been on C#, but I&#8217;ve worked with many languages over the years.</p>
<p>When I was in the 7th grade, one of the other students made a Myst clone with Hypercard using photos taken around the school.  That seemed like <em>pure magic</em>, so I wanted to find out how software is made.  Like most people who get into this subject at an early age, my goal was to make games.</p>
<p>My first programming language was Pascal.  I used Turbo Pascal, whose IDE lived in text mode.  It actually had a pretty decent debugger, one quite similar to what you get with Visual Studio today.  Pascal is a little verbose with keywords, but that came in handy to a total newbie.  Its type system was simple: you start with basic things like ints and strings, and then declare compound types like arrays and records in terms of simpler types.  It was neat to see the way you could build up ever-more complex types in terms of the primitives.</p>
<p>After taking a year of Pascal in high school, we switched to C++.  At first, it seemed to be only superficially different.  Instead of <em><code>Writeln("Hello")</code></em>, you <em><code>cout&lt;&lt;"Hello"</code></em>.  Type names appeared <em>before</em> variables now.  The first new thing that came up was pointers.  It wasn&#8217;t <em>too</em> different, but it was pretty neat, and I got a better idea of how interesting types could be built up from this new primitive concept.  Still, C++ didn&#8217;t seam too Earth-shattering compared to Pascal.  I figured all software development would feel like this.</p>
<p><strong>Then I saw Perl for the first time during an internship, and it blew my mind!</strong></p>
<p>Perl was weird and ugly in a glorious sort of way.  The Camel Book, written by the creator of Perl, didn&#8217;t just tell me how to write &#8220;Hello&#8221; to the screen or how to declare functions.  Instead, it was <em>entertaining</em>, downright <em>whimsical</em> at times, and that reflected the fun I had playing with Perl.  Right out of the box, I got to work with interesting things like hashes and regular expressions.  I saw the appeal of the brevity that came from some of the shortcuts it takes.</p>
<p>I had a semester of Functional Programming with Scheme, but I didn&#8217;t really &#8220;get it&#8221; at the time.  I wish I had… I&#8217;ve since come to really enjoy working with lambda expressions, and Scheme is <em>lousy</em> with them.</p>
<p>In my second internship, I worked briefly with Tcl (pronounced &#8220;tickle&#8221;).  In Tcl, &#8220;everything is a string&#8221;, and when everything is a string, you have to start stretching your definition of things like &#8220;string&#8221; and &#8220;quotation marks&#8221;.  All data types in Tcl can be manipulated as strings, even blocks of code!  This was my first exposure (second, if I had actually understood Scheme) to the idea that code itself can be a value, something you can pass around from one function to another.</p>
<p><strong>During senior year and in a fit of youthful recklessness, I had an affair with PHP.  Please accept my heartfelt apologies.</strong></p>
<p>Python started to appeal to me as an alternative to PHP&#8217;s inconsistency and Perl&#8217;s readability issues.  Like with any language, you&#8217;re going to be surprised by some of the details, but by and large Python&#8217;s simplicity just makes sense.  Operator overloading feels very natural; your operators are just methods with special names.  Significant whitespace is weird at first, but it mimics the way I write psuedocode on paper.  Slices, lazy generators, and list comprehensions are all just really slick concepts.</p>
<p>Ruby re-re-reintroduces functional programming for the masses without making it <em>feel</em> like functional programming.  Ruby blocks are similar to lambdas of other languages, but combined with nonlocal returns you gain the ability to define your own control flow constructs.  It&#8217;s as if you can add new keywords to the language.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used Clojure much, but it does seem like the first Lisp capable of grabbing wide-ish appeal.  It gives you just a <em>little</em> more syntax out of the box than other Lisps, and the built-in data structures are really interesting and opinionated.</p>
<p>Haskell forces you to rethink something that other languages take for granted: the order of evaluation of <strong>everything</strong>.  It also forces you to realize just how little of your code <em>really</em> has to deal with mutable state.</p>
<p>As I said above, C# has been my focus lately.  It&#8217;s a bit of a kitchen sink.  Every few years, it gains a pretty significant upgrade.  The first version was suspiciously similar to Java, but since then they have diverged greatly.  Properties help with readability, generics are far stronger than their Java counterparts, delegates and lambda expressions introduced functional programming constructs, LINQ introduced <em>freaking monads</em>, and you can even opt-into dynamic method invocation reminiscent of Python and Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>Since C# exposes the developer to such a wide array of concepts from a wide variety of preceding languages, C# is a bit of a polyglot.</strong>  C# is a toolbelt with many tools.  You can pull out only the tools you need, when they&#8217;re appropriate for the job you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><strong>Software developers should take the opportunity to similarly fill their own toolbelts.</strong>  We should expose ourselves to as many languages as possible.  Doing so will give you career security, expand your mind, and strengthen your problem-solving skills.  Most importantly, it&#8217;s just plain fun.</p>
<p>Fellow-Headspringer <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/get-to-know-a-developer-sharon-cichelli/">Sharon Cichelli</a> is creating a new organization, the <a href="http://www.polyglotprogrammers.org/">Polyglot Programmers of Austin</a>, to help foster this effort.  Be sure to come by the second and fourth Thursday of each month to learn from your peers, to share what you&#8217;ve been learning, and to see just how green the grass is on the other sides of things.  Sometimes, the grass is purple.</p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Justin Pope</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/get-to-know-a-developer-justin-pope/justin-pope" rel="attachment wp-att-3315"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3315" title="Justin Pope" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/justin-pope-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Justin Pope began his career working on standardized test score reporting systems and data warehouses for K-12 teachers.  These project teams designed applications that help teachers spend more time in the classroom teaching and less time learning how to use confusing new technology. He joined the Headspring team in 2010 looking for opportunities to enhance the user experience on projects across several clients each year.  When I have talked to other consultants, they all say Justin is really relied on for his unique ability to empathize with the client.  Here is how our conversation about web development went:</p>
<p><strong>You have done the most Brown Bag Lunch Presentations out of all our developers.  Which one was your favorite?</strong></p>
<p>The one I did on Fluent Validation.  I called it “Conquering Complex Client Crud”.  It was the first time I took a new skill, one that I had not already been using for years, and shared it right away.  I knew about ¾ of it, and learned the rest specifically so that I could better answer any questions.  It drove me to dig deep into understanding the source code and its limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>I love teaching!  In college, I considered becoming a high school computer science or math teacher because I enjoy teaching and have a natural talent for it.  I decided not to, because I didn’t want to deal with rebellious students who didn’t want to be in class. At Headspring, teaching boot camps is one of my favorite things to do because all the developers are excited to be there and ready to learn.</p>
<p><strong>What are your plans for the future?</strong></p>
<p>I want to have a start up one day and significantly change something about the world.  I’ve found with technology, it’s easy for a great idea like mint.com, or legalzoom.com, or meetup.com to improve the quality of life for people, and I want to make a similar impact on the world.</p>
<p><strong>What do you wish the industry cared more about?</strong></p>
<p>I wish my peers – other developers at other companies – cared more about ROI.  A lot of times I see other developers get caught up in rules and absolutes, rather than seeing the big picture.  For example, this can happen a lot with testing.  Sometimes, a developer will write an entire test for something, just in case it needs to be refactored.  But refactoring might be unlikely, and if it is, the person executing may think the test is garbage and throw it out.  Yes, testing is important, but what is the ROI on the time it takes to create a test that might or might not be used by some other operator in the future?</p>
<p><strong>What do you like most about front-end development?</strong></p>
<p>I like creating an efficient workflow, and a lot of times you can get the easiest returns on improving the front-end experience.  There is always room for improvement that immediate impacts the user.</p>
<p>If you would like to read about some of the projects that Justin worked on, visit our<a href="http://www.headspring.com/success-stories"> Success Stories</a> page and read about <a href="http://www.headspring.com/success-stories/legisym">Legisym </a>or <a href="http://www.headspring.com/success-stories/myopenjobs">MyOpenJobs</a>.

			Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 2</a>
	</h2>

		<p>In my <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/customizing-visual-studio-with-external-tools-part-1">previous post</a> I showed you how to configure your own External Tools in Visual Studio, such as a command that opens up the current document in an external text editor, or a tool that launches a custom deployment executable. External Tools by default are accessed through the Tools menu, but this is lame. In this post I’ll show you to create your own toolbar to contain your tools so they are no more than one click away.</p>
<h2>Creating a custom toolbar</h2>
<p>To create a custom toolbar, click Tools &gt; Customize&#8230; or right-click in the open space in the toolbar area and select “Customize…” at the very bottom of this context menu. Click “New…” to create a new toolbar and give it a name and click OK, then close this dialog box.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image4.png" alt="Creating a new toolbar" width="445" height="456" border="0" /></p>
<p>It may appear that nothing has happened, but your toolbar has been added, it’s just empty. Look closely at your toolbars and you should be able to spot it:</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image5.png" alt="Customize your toolbar" width="204" height="77" border="0" /></p>
<p>Click on the arrow, then “Add or Remove Buttons” then “Customize”. From this dialog, click “Add Command…”. Here you’ll see two lists, one for categories and another for the commands associated with the selected category.  Find and select the “Tools” category, then select the “External Command 1” command.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image6.png" alt="Add commands to your toolbar" width="494" height="355" border="0" /></p>
<p>The process is certainly a little cumbersome, but you’ll get the hang of it after doing it once or twice. The “External Commands” listed in the Commands window correspond with the external tools you have [previously configured –link to post #1]. It’s not magical enough to know the name of the external tools you’ve configured, so you’ll have to keep track of what you’ve created and the order they are in. In my example, I have three external tools configured, and I’m going to add each of them to my toolbar: External Command 1, External Command 2, and External Command 3.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image7.png" alt="External Commands correspond to the External Tools you have, in order" width="324" height="229" border="0" /></p>
<p>When you are done, close out any remaining open dialogs and your custom toolbar should be all set!</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image8.png" alt="A custom toolbar!" width="266" height="42" border="0" /></p>

			Get to Know a Developer: Pedro Reys</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/get-to-know-a-developer-pedro-reys/pedro" rel="attachment wp-att-3276"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3276" title="pedro" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pedro-291x300.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="240" /></a>This week I spent some time getting to know Pedro Reys, one of our Senior Consultants at Headspring.  We had a great time talking about <em>consuming</em> technology, and what that means in the past, present and the future.  While we both agreed that invention of indoor plumbing (originally my suggestion) was an important milestone in technology, the internet has ultimately surpassed any and all twenty-first century technical advancements.  Here’s how the rest of our conversation went:</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about how you progressed from a good developer to a great developer.</strong></p>
<p>Since joining Headspring, I do more back-end work than front-end work, but that wasn’t on purpose.  I did a lot of web development before coming here, and I still enjoy reading up on what’s new in web development.  Part of being a consultant is being exposed to everything, so I have gone from good to great by broadening my skill set.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like most about being a consultant?</strong></p>
<p>I like the exposure and the challenges.  I would get really bored if I was just doing one more of the same thing all the time.  Consulting work is never monotonous because I get to work with all sorts of different companies, teams, and products.  I find that to be a really rewarding process.</p>
<p><strong>What do you wish more people in the tech industry cared about?</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to find developers that 1) know their craft well 2) do their part in the community and 3) have people skills.  Many of our clients come to us with bad experiences from great consultancies that have great developers, but fail in the people department.   Being a consultant has taught me to really listen to the client, focus on a smart solution, and choose my battles wisely.  I wish more developers spent time learning how to communicate with people as well as they do with machines.</p>
<p><strong>What companies do you admire?</strong></p>
<p>Zappos has really great customer service.  I bought a pair of shoes as a gift for someone recently, but they ended up being the wrong size.  I contacted a rep, and he was very understanding.  I did not feel like he was just trying to get rid of me.  He expedited shipping on a new pair, free of charge, no questions asked.  This week, they were hacked, and I got an upfront email explaining what happened and what they were planning to do about it.  I liked the transparency of their email, and how they handled it says a lot about their brand’s values.</p>
<p><strong>What technology do you wish you had sooner?</strong></p>
<p>The Wikipedia blackout really affected me.  I don’t know how I managed to get through college without it.  It would have been awesome to have Wikipedia when I was in school.  Also, I wish I had an iPhone sooner.  How did I get around before?  I know life existed before the internet, but it’s a lot better now that we have it.  It’s much more important to be able to know how to get the information you need faster than just having it memorized.</p>

			Early Experiences With Unit Testing</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/plioi/">Patrick Lioi</a></p>
<p>I got my feet wet with unit testing during a summer internship, before the term was officially on my radar. I was writing a number-crunching library in C, and my tests took the form of short C programs using that library. They would run through several related examples and print to the console when something went wrong. It&#8217;s a shame that I was a senior in college before the concept even came up, but at least I got exposure to it before graduating and entering the workforce. This approach actually helped me to catch a pretty serious and subtle error that I wasn&#8217;t explicitly looking for.</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The project involved a lot of number crunching for an electron-detector that would be mounted on a satellite. Picture a 180 degree protractor stuck on the side of a spinning box. At time 0, we might get a reading of an electron coming from 15 degrees. At time 1 we might get another reading coming from 42 degrees.</p>
<p>These numbers on their own were completely meaningless, because the device was ignorant of the fact that it was mounted on the side of a spinning satellite. 15 degrees right now is a completely different direction from 15 degrees a moment from now. The idea is that we needed to &#8216;rotate&#8217; the raw data backwards, against the angle the satellite would rotate through, to know what direction it really came from.</p>
<p>To complicate matters, the satellite would be orbiting the Earth, and in turn orbiting the Sun, introducing more angles to reverse-rotate. As fuel was consumed, a predictable wobble would be introduced, leading to several other rotations to reverse-rotate. Additionally, we needed to translate the resulting 3D coordinates in terms of a convenient coordinate system: some convienient origin (0, 0, 0) with well-defined X, Y, and Z axes. Different people needed to see the results according to different coordinate systems. Some wanted the origin to be the center of the Earth, with Z+ moving throught the magnetic north pole, some wanted the origin to be the center of the sun with Z+ perpendicular to the plane Earth moves through, etc.</p>
<p>The bottom line was that the physicists would determine exactly what rotations were involved, and how to calculate it all in terms of the initial start position of the satellite and a known time to start the clock. I just had to turn the crank and calculate what those rules dictated.</p>
<h2>The Short Cut</h2>
<p>It turns out there&#8217;s a neat short-cut when doing multiple rotations around 3D axes. It comes up in 3D graphics, too. There&#8217;s a way to build a 3x3 matrix representing a single rotation around a single one of the 3 possible axes. If you multiply that matrix against a single 3D data point, you get a new data point showing where it had really come from. Each bit of the phsysicist&#8217;s work could be turned into such a matrix, and if you multiplied all of these together you&#8217;d get yet another 3x3 matrix representing the <em>combination</em> of all the many rotations. Armed with this, you could very quickly process all the data points without having to do a lot of trig for each one individually. The goal was to have a 3x3 grid of numbers that bottled up <em>every</em> operation to perform.</p>
<h2>My First Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Despite that simplification, <strong>I was sure I was going to make mistakes</strong>. I started writing very short programs to test my matrix-twiddling library as I went along. I had some concrete examples from the physicists and from the satellite&#8217;s documentation to get me started. <strong>Occasionally I&#8217;d be surprised by a result, and would know something was either wrong with my code or with my understanding of the problem.</strong> Not doing so would have been unprofessional, and it would have surely produced a useless mess: a program that would serve only to make the machine warmer for the few minutes it ran.</p>
<p><strong>It was really rewarding to see how the testing effort motivated my approach to the implementation.</strong> It forced me to start thinking in terms of the smaller building blocks. Once I was confident in the individual parts, I&#8217;d write the next set of tests at a higher level to test how those parts worked together. I generally hate Lego analogies for writing software, but there was a nearly-audible plasticky <em>click</em> whenever a new operation started passing its tests.</p>
<h2>The Payoff, or Why We Should All Be Right-Handed</h2>
<p>Eventually this testing found a <em>very big</em> discrepancy between the explanation of the rotations involved, and the documentation of the satellite, even though both documents were intended as a matching set.</p>
<p>In middle school Algebra, we always draw +Y moving up the page, and +X moving to the right of the page. That&#8217;s just a convention; it makes sense only because we&#8217;re all agreeing that we will do it that way. When you introduce 3D, you have to decide whether the +Z axis is coming &#8220;up&#8221; out of the page, or &#8220;down&#8221; into the table the page sits on. One of these is called a left-handed system, and the other is called a right-handed system. Again, it&#8217;s just convention; if everyone agrees on what we&#8217;re using, everything is fine.</p>
<p>The satellite&#8217;s examples used the opposite +Z from the documentation of the angles to reverse-rotate. Every time we needed to rotate around Z, we were going in the wrong direction!</p>
<p><strong>I never would have discovered this problem if I hadn&#8217;t been building up a test-suite alongside the library.</strong> It was just dumb luck that I got to experience a unit-testing &#8220;A-HA!&#8221; moment so long ago, but I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>

			Joining the Dark Side: Learning to Code With Grace and Dignity</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Upon the suggestion of a coworker I joined 342,787 people (and counting) with a 2012 resolution to learn how to code.  It’s called <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear</a>, presented by <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0">CodeAcademy</a>, supported by companies like YCombinator, and made viral by the addition of my fellow student, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/05/bloomberg-codecademy/">Michael Bloomberg</a>.   It’s a very simple, learn as you go platform, with big clean buttons and “dumbed down” explanations for the average Joe (or Jill).  I get an email every Monday with a new lesson to work on for the week.  As I progress, I earn badges and bragging rights to publish on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>There are a number of courses and levels to choose from, and I have just completed the first one, “Getting Started with Programming”.  After creating an account, I can sign in and access courses that I am working on and track my progress.</p>
<p>Here are a couple screen shots which demonstrate the clean design and learning module:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/joining-the-dark-side-learning-to-code-with-grace-and-dignity/code-academy-courses1-2" rel="attachment wp-att-3178"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3178" title="code academy courses1" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/code-academy-courses11-1024x554.png" alt="" width="614" height="332" /></a><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/joining-the-dark-side-learning-to-code-with-grace-and-dignity/code-academy-lesson1" rel="attachment wp-att-3155"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3155" title="code academy lesson1" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/code-academy-lesson1-1024x554.png" alt="" width="819" height="443" /></a></p>
<p>Now, let me take the time to clearly state that <strong>I have absolutely no intention of becoming a programmer</strong>. If I wanted to be a programmer, there are plenty of resources out there for entering a career in programming, all of which existed long before CodeAcademy came along.  What attracts me to this particular platform is that it is built specifically for non-technical people to learn how to think like a technical person when needed.</p>
<p>I can already tell this is going to be a very beneficial process for me.</p>
<p>I am surrounded by developers at work and at home, and I have found that they are a unique breed of communicators.  You see, in marketing, we care about the ideas, elaborating on them, and we don’t care much for the process of getting from A to B.</p>
<p><strong>Conversely, developers (good ones) care about the process just as much as they care about the conclusion</strong>.  Words, steps, and systems are really important to them.  They think the way code looks!  If a statement at the top of a string of code does not compute correctly, then the statement at the bottom of the string of code cannot compute either, <em>even if</em> that second statement is true.  Let me demonstrate with a snippet from Lesson 8 of “Getting Started with Programming”:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The while loop defined in the editor code won&#8217;t ever run because its condition, times <code>&gt;</code> 0 <code>&amp;&amp;</code>times <code>&lt;</code> 3, is never true since times <code>=</code> 0 and the two conditions 0 <code>&gt;</code> 0 <code>&amp;&amp;</code> 0 <code>&lt;</code> 3 evaluates tofalse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If the conditions of the loop aren&#8217;t met, the code will be skipped entirely.</p>
<p>Does this read like a familiar scenario? Now that I have been exposed to the process of coding, I am starting to notice the similarities between speaking to a developer and reading what a developer creates.</p>
<p>And the benefits don’t stop with enhanced communication.  I’m looking forward to being a more versatile teammate, not having to ask so many questions, and the possibility of using code to make my daily tasks easier.</p>
<p>But don’t take my word for it.  There are plenty of helpful blogs out there that detail the benefits of learning to code, like this one: <a href="http://www.giftrocket.com/why-marketing-bd-should-learn-to-code">10 Reasons Why Marketing and BD Professionals Should Learn to Code</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have ever considered learning how to code, I encourage you to visit <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear.com</a>, or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23codeyear">#codeyear</a> trending topic on Twitter (follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/headspring">@headspring</a> while you&#8217;re there).</p>

			Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Visual Studio has some deep customization options and extensibility points that many of us just ignore. Once such option is “External Tools” which allow you to create a menu item (and optional toolbar) that can run any external program you wish.</p>
<p>I recently had to set up a couple of new computing environments so I went through my typical routine of setting up <em>Explorer.exe</em> as an external tool, and while doing so I pondered a few other tools that might be useful. In this and subsequent posts, I’ll describe how to set up some simple external tools, create a custom tool bar for them and even add them to the context menu.</p>
<p>In your menu, go to <strong>Tools &gt; External Tools</strong>. You may already have some present like Dotfuscator or a Guid generator.</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border-style: initial;border-color: initial;border-width: 0px" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image2.png" alt="Visual Studio External Tools" width="371" height="362" border="0" /></p>
<p>Setting up a tool is fairly simple: You can see above I have Windows Explorer configured with the /select argument to select the file based on the $(ItemPath) variable. More on this on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ekbzk5f8.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN – Arguments for External Tools</a>. When you launch this tool it will open Explorer to the currently active/selected file (either in your editor or the one selected in your solution explorer). I find it a handy shortcut when I need to explore to a file deep within a solution.</p>
<h2>Other External Tools</h2>
<p>I recently added my other favorite editor, <em>Notepad++,</em> to my tools.  Instead of exploring to the currently active file, it will open it up in Notepad++ which is where I find myself editing project files, csv files and other documents that I don’t need to edit with Visual Studio. You can configure Notepad++ with:</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Notepad++ (or anything you wish)</p>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: C:Program Files (x86)Notepad++notepad++.exe (location of the exe)</p>
<p><strong>Arguments</strong>: $(ItemPath)</p>
<p>At Headspring, we use the open-source <a href="https://bitbucket.org/headspringlabs/tarantino/wiki/Home" target="_blank">Tarantino Project</a> to deploy many of our applications. On some projects the deployer executable resides somewhere in a <em>lib</em> folder within the project which means you have to walk through at least a few directories to get to it. I recently made a batch file to launch it straight from the command line from the root of a project, and so I went ahead and turned this .bat file into an external tool while I was at it.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Tarantino Deployer</p>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: $(SolutionDir)..Deploy.bat</p>
<p><strong>Arguments</strong>: /min (this hides the cmd window)</p>
<p>The Deploy.bat file sites in the same folder as the .sln file does and simply points to the relative location of the deployer exe:</p>
<p>@echo off<br />
Start /D.libdeployer .libdeployerTarantino.Deployer.exe</p>
<h2>Launching External Tools</h2>
<p>Once you’ve set up your tools in the dialog shown above, they will appear in your tools menu like so:</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px;border-style: initial;border-color: initial;border-width: 0px" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image3.png" alt="Visual Studio Tools Menu" width="238" height="383" border="0" /></p>
<p>Stay tuned for more! In the next post I’ll walk you through making your own custom Visual Studio toolbar to contain your tools.</p>

			Refactoring Pong</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of my first successes with refactoring was in a text-mode Pong clone.  My parents got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a> for my brother and me when I was in middle school.  The first nontrivial thing I made was Pong.  Instead of plotting individual pixels, the screen was drawn with plain text.  An asterisk was the ball, and the paddles were drawn with vertical | bars.</p>
<p>I was extremely proud of the way the ball would bounce around the screen.  It would detect when the ball hit a side wall or a paddle, changing direction.  At first, the code that handled this collision detection was enormous.  I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, so every step of the way was very verbose.  I didn&#8217;t quite start out with the right data structure to represent the ball, so every time I wanted to <em>say</em> something about it, I&#8217;d write another awkward function that <em>worked</em> but made things ever-more <em>complicated</em>..</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all experienced that feeling on at least one past project.  &quot;This thing is getting away from us, and fast!&quot;</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I&#8217;d realize that a few lines here or there could be simplfied.  I&#8217;d see that if I made a particular helper function, then the body of my 4-page switch statement could be shortened to 1 page.  I chipped away at the stone, a little bit at a time.  Holy crap, that was fun.</p>
<p>At one point I realized that if the ball&#8217;s <em>speed</em> in the X and Y directions could be <em>negative</em>, I didn&#8217;t have to track <em>direction</em> as a separate concept via an enum.  After that, all the ball-bouncing code collapsed on its own, as if by magic, down to a few lines.  Best of all, those few lines made sense.  No gargantuan switch statement.  No awkwardly-phrased statements.  <strong>I was finally saying what I meant.</strong></p>
<p>On real-world software projects, we can&#8217;t allow ourselves to get into the trap of perpetually-refactoring-everything for no good reason.  It is fun and intellectually satisfying, but once you let yourself lose site of where you are <em>headed</em>, you might be introducing some very expensive waste.  Still, you have to weigh the cost of this effort against the cost of <em>not</em> doing it.  <strong>Refactoring while you make forward progress</strong>, and not as an occasional recess from work, may help you to make these decisions more responsibly.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re writing Pong, though, just have fun.</p>
