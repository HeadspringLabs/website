	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In my <a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/customizing-visual-studio-with-external-tools-part-1">previous post</a> I showed you how to configure your own External Tools in Visual Studio, such as a command that opens up the current document in an external text editor, or a tool that launches a custom deployment executable. External Tools by default are accessed through the Tools menu, but this is lame. In this post I’ll show you to create your own toolbar to contain your tools so they are no more than one click away.

			Early Experiences With Unit Testing</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By <a href="http://www.headspring.com/author/plioi/">Patrick Lioi</a></p>
<p>I got my feet wet with unit testing during a summer internship, before the term was officially on my radar. I was writing a number-crunching library in C, and my tests took the form of short C programs using that library. They would run through several related examples and print to the console when something went wrong. It&#8217;s a shame that I was a senior in college before the concept even came up, but at least I got exposure to it before graduating and entering the workforce. This approach actually helped me to catch a pretty serious and subtle error that I wasn&#8217;t explicitly looking for.

			Joining the Dark Side: Learning to Code With Grace and Dignity</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Upon the suggestion of a coworker I joined 342,787 people (and counting) with a 2012 resolution to learn how to code.  It’s called <a href="http://codeyear.com/">CodeYear</a>, presented by <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0">CodeAcademy</a>, supported by companies like YCombinator, and made viral by the addition of my fellow student, <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/05/bloomberg-codecademy/">Michael Bloomberg</a>.   It’s a very simple, learn as you go platform, with big clean buttons and “dumbed down” explanations for the average Joe (or Jill).  I get an email every Monday with a new lesson to work on for the week.  As I progress, I earn badges and bragging rights to publish on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>There are a number of courses and levels to choose from, and I have just completed the first one, “Getting Started with Programming”.  After creating an account, I can sign in and access courses that I am working on and track my progress.

			Customizing Visual Studio With External Tools, Part 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Visual Studio has some deep customization options and extensibility points that many of us just ignore. Once such option is “External Tools” which allow you to create a menu item (and optional toolbar) that can run any external program you wish.</p>
<p>I recently had to set up a couple of new computing environments so I went through my typical routine of setting up <em>Explorer.exe</em> as an external tool, and while doing so I pondered a few other tools that might be useful. In this and subsequent posts, I’ll describe how to set up some simple external tools, create a custom tool bar for them and even add them to the context menu.

			Refactoring Pong</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of my first successes with refactoring was in a text-mode Pong clone.  My parents got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a> for my brother and me when I was in middle school.  The first nontrivial thing I made was Pong.  Instead of plotting individual pixels, the screen was drawn with plain text.  An asterisk was the ball, and the paddles were drawn with vertical | bars.</p>
<p>I was extremely proud of the way the ball would bounce around the screen.  It would detect when the ball hit a side wall or a paddle, changing direction.  At first, the code that handled this collision detection was enormous.  I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, so every step of the way was very verbose.  I didn&#8217;t quite start out with the right data structure to represent the ball, so every time I wanted to <em>say</em> something about it, I&#8217;d write another awkward function that <em>worked</em> but made things ever-more <em>complicated</em>..

<p>This week’s spotlight is on Ryan Vice, one of our newest Principal Consultants at Headspring.  He is currently in the final stages of authoring, <em>MVVM Survival Guide for Enterprise Architectures in WPF and Silverlight</em>.  Here is our conversation:</p>
<p><strong>What led to you focusing on WPF?</strong></p>
<p>During my time at Money Management International, I was the Workflow lead and that position included the responsibility for both the workflow engine and the related user interface components.  During that time I became active on the MSDN Workflow Foundation forums and was one of the top answerers throughout that year. This lead to me being offered a slot at Houston’s Tech Fest, which lead to blog content which then lead to me receiving Microsoft MVP award in connected systems. Once that project had wrapped up I couldn’t find any other projects on Workflow Foundation which I really enjoy and so I looked for projects in WPF which is also a XAML based WinFX technology. At the time I was looking to specialize in WinFX and continue to try and increase the level of my contributions to the development community around WinFX.

			When Does a Loyalty System Do More Harm Than Good?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Chances are, if you’re reading this you’re a member of at least one loyalty program. While the days of the key ring with a dozen fobs are fading into the rear view mirror, the proliferation of rewards programs won’t be stopping any time soon. As an original member Burger King kids club (I was the one with the green sunglasses and skateboard) I’ve seen a lot of really cool loyalty programs, and I’ve also seen some really ineffective ones. A poorly executed loyalty program can alienate your most valuable customers, and cost you a hell of a lot of money doing it. Here are the most common mistakes that companies make.

			ToString, or Not ToString</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the first things people learn about .NET is that every Object can be turned into a string by invoking ToString(), and that this method can be overridden.  This method gets overridden for several different <em>reasons</em>, which kind of muddies the waters.  Sometimes it&#8217;s overridden so that the object can be rendered for the user&#8217;s eyes, and sometimes it&#8217;s used to output debugging information for the developer&#8217;s eyes.  By default, it simply gives the namespace-qualified type name.

She is even a regular attendee and sometime presenter for a community group named <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Austin-All-Girl-Hack-Night/">Austin All-Girl Hack Night</a>.  However, there is no convincing Sharon, that in spite of her coolness, she&#8217;s good at being girlie.</p>
<p>Getting to know her this week proved to be a very enjoyable experience. I wish that I could share our full conversation, but that would require a series in and of itself. Here are some highlights:
