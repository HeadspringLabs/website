			Code Whittling</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Reading other people&#8217;s code is a valuable learning exercise, but it can be very difficult no matter how experienced or talented the original developers were.  It&#8217;s tough to read other people&#8217;s code, especially on projects you are unfamiliar with.  You may be a fan of an open-source project, and want to learn from it, but get lost once you start trying to read through it.  Even if the project was exceptionally well-written, the size of the project and its unfamiliar concepts may be obstacles to an outside observer.</p>
<p>In recent months, I tried to learn how two open-source projects work: <a href="https://github.com/hibernating-rhinos/rhino-licensing">Rhino Licensing</a> and <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com/">xUnit</a>.  In each case, I immediately ran into the typical problem: I didn&#8217;t know where to start to really get a feel for how these projects work, and the thought of just opening Solution Explorer and reading through each file in random order just didn&#8217;t seem like it would be useful.</p>
<p>Our brains don&#8217;t work like IDEs.  I can&#8217;t just read 100,000 lines of code and expect to retain enough of that information to be useful.  Instead, I took a different tack.  When I&#8217;m actually working on a team project, I don&#8217;t find myself sitting still, idly reading thousands of lines of code straight through.  That would be ridiculous, so why was I about to do precisely that to learn about these other projects?</p>
<p>Instead of pointlessly trying to read and remember everything, I wanted to pursue two other goals simultaneously: engaging with the code like an active contributor while discovering and honing in on the most relevant parts.</p>
<p><strong>Act like a contributor:</strong>  When working on a real project for a client, I don&#8217;t just sit there and read the team&#8217;s contributions straight through, for the same reason that didn&#8217;t work while reading other people&#8217;s open-source projects.  Instead, we all gain an understanding of a project over time, <em>through active and repeated interaction with the code</em>.  I need to implement feature X, which is similar to feature Y, so I start searching for feature Y.  Maybe I compare its implementation to the user interface.  Maybe I see something surprising that I would have forgotten to do in my own feature.  Heck, maybe I find a bug, or a way to make both features share most of their implementation.  Maybe it&#8217;s not obvious how a particular identifier affects the system, so I do an <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/escape-analysis/">escape analysis</a> for it&#8230;</p>
<p>In all of these activities, our hands are glued to keyboards: writing code, refactoring code, searching through code paths, and the like.  If we simulate these activities while trying to learn about someone else&#8217;s open-source project, we are more likely to benefit from the activity in the same way we benefit from these activities on our own &#8220;real&#8221; projects.</p>
<p><strong>Hone in on what&#8217;s relevant:</strong>  Large projects are daunting, and small projects aren&#8217;t.  Usually, there is a particular part of a project you happen to use the most and are interested in learning about.  Everything else in the project is a distracting obstacle.  By deliberately removing the parts that aren&#8217;t too important to you, it&#8217;ll be easier to focus on the parts you do care about.</p>
<p>I like to think of this combined activity as &#8220;Code Whittling&#8221;.  You destroy a project from the outside in, learning about it as you go.</p>
<h2>Destroying a Project</h2>
<p>I started by creating a throwaway clone of the tool I wanted to learn about.  Then, I thought of its features from the point of view of someone <em>using</em> it within their own project, and identified the main features that I <em>don&#8217;t</em> care about.  These feature may very well be useful, but were unrelated to the ones I really wanted to learn about.  I started violently removing those &quot;irrelevant&quot; features left and right.  After gutting the major features I wasn&#8217;t interested in learning about, I was left with a smaller task and had a better feel for the high-level organization of the project.</p>
<p>Even at this point, though, I didn&#8217;t stop whittling.  Within the features I <em>did</em> care about, there were now some unused classes, unused methods, and unused fields, some identified by ReSharper.  I started removing these, too, which in some cases had a cascading effect.  This step left me with the code that I really wanted to learn about.</p>
<p>Armed with the confidence of working with something that was now smaller and somewhat familiar, I started applying small refactorings.  Within a pefectly good and still-used method, I would try to rewrite parts in my own style.  &quot;If I was the original contributor, how would I have implemented <em>this</em> tiny bit here?&quot; or, &quot;If I was going to write an alternative project, what would I have named <em>that</em> concept?&quot;</p>
<p>I found that actually <em>working</em> with the code like this, even though the &quot;work&quot; itself was not strictly productive, helped me to get a better understanding of the project than I would have gotten simply reading through it all.  This activity kept me focused, and helped me to see the major concepts through the eyes of the real contributors, all while honing in on the information I was originally after.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we&#8217;ll walk through this process on a few open-source projects, starting with my previous experiences whittling Rhino Licensing and xUnit.</p>

<h2>The Windows Installer Runtime Sequence</h2>
<p>When a software installation actually takes place, there&#8217;s actually a certain sequence of events that Windows Installer follows.  It&#8217;s critical to understand this sequence for several reasons.  The entire sequence isn&#8217;t always guaranteed to run (the user might perform a silent install), and only certain parts of the sequence are transactional and you don&#8217;t want to affect the target machine outside that range of events.</p>
<p>The installation process is divided into two phases:  the UI or acquisition phase, and the execution phase.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/nolan/creating-windows-installers-with-the-wix-toolset-part-04/phasesofaninstall/" rel="attachment wp-att-6310"><img src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/phasesOfAnInstall.png" alt="Diagram with UI or Acquisition phase followed by Execution phase with immediate mode and deferred mode. Rollback arrow across execution phase." title="Phases of a Windows Install" width="649" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6310" /></a></p>
<h3>UI/Acquisition phase</h3>
<p>This is usually the first phase.  This is the phase where the user is presented with a series of screens guiding them through the install process, possibly asking for any needed information and perhaps providing a chance to customize the location on the filesystem to install the application.</p>
<p>However, if the user performs a silent install, this phase will be skipped!  Because of this you need to be sure that you have default values or actions for anything you prompt the user for.  You also need to be sure not to perform any setup actions in this phase because it might not run.</p>
<h3>Execution phase</h3>
<p>This is the second phase where Windows Installer actually performs the install.  Unlike the UI phase it will always run, and it does so in two modes that are rather confusingly named:  immediate and deferred.</p>
<p>In immediate mode, Windows Installer scans through the entire MSI and prepares a script of steps to execute to perform the installation.  It doesn&#8217;t actually make any changes at this point, it just compiles all the specified resources and actions into a transcript to be applied after the entire MSI is scanned and compiled into the transcript.</p>
<p>In deferred mode the compiled transcript of changes is actually applied to the target computer.</p>
<h3>Rollback</h3>
<p>If at any point during the execution phase an error occurs, Windows Installer will halt and perform a rollback of all operations previously applied.  This makes the execution phase transactional - either the entire set of operations is applied, or none of them.  As always there are some caveats and exceptions around this (e.g. running a custom action method that doesn&#8217;t have a compensating rollback method), but all basic file operations will be undone.</p>

<h2>Free Options</h2>
<p>There are several free options for authoring Windows installers, including WiX.  One of these is Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS).  NSIS was created a number of years ago in order to distribute a media player called Winamp.  Some reasons to consider NSIS are that it&#8217;s relatively simple and straightforward to learn, and it supports a plugin system to extend it.  Some reasons to avoid NSIS are it&#8217;s relatively old (the last release was in 2009), and the size of the community using it has been dwindling as a result.  You can check out NSIS <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.</p>
<p> Another free option with a lot of current traction is Inno Setup.  It&#8217;s been around nearly as long as NSIS and is being more actively updated.  It has a custom Pascal scripting engine to customize the install process, and appears to have a few features (such as Unicode support) that NSIS doesn&#8217;t.  You can find out more at the Inno Setup <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">website</a>.</p>
<p> Both NSIS and Inno Setup have one major drawback compared to WiX - neither use the Windows Installer system in Windows discussed in a previous <a href="http://www.headspring.com/nolan/creating-windows-installers-with-the-wix-toolset-part-02/">part</a>.  Whether or not this matters depends on whether your application targets consumers or corporations.  Consumers are not going to care much HOW software installs on their machine as long as it works and doesn&#8217;t silently add malware.  Corporations on the other hand have concerns well beyond the average consumer.  This includes things like inspecting the contents of the installer for worrisome system configuration changes, customizing the installer with separate transforms to meet IT standards, and safely allowing nonadmin users to run an installer that needs some admin privileges.  There&#8217;s a great discussion about the advantages of Windows Installer at <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/11670/advantages-of-using-msi-files/274609#274609">ServerFault</a> (msi files are Windows Installer packages).</p>
<p> So if WiX has all these great features compared to Inno Setup, what disadvantages does it have?  In my opinion the answer to this is easily the steep learning curve.  Because WiX is essentially a wrapper around the concepts in Windows Installer, you MUST understand Windows Installer to use it effectively.  This will be the topic of future discussions in this series.</p>
<h2>Commercial Options</h2>
<p>There are some commercial options that have more polish and user friendliness than WiX.  The two that appear to be most popular are <a href="http://www.advancedinstaller.com/">Advanced Installer</a> and <a href="http://www.installshield.com/">InstallShield</a>.  I have not used either because my installer needs are so irregular that I haven&#8217;t been able to justify the licensing cost for an occasional &#8220;one off&#8221; installer project, but if your job responsibilities include fulltime or near fulltime work with Windows installers you probably want to investigate them as an option.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There are a variety of tooling options for your installer needs.  If you have a sufficiently simple software product and aren&#8217;t targeting corporate installs, Inno Setup might be a good fit.  If you have more advanced needs that Inno Setup cannot handle, or your targeting corporations that have deployment requirements and standards, you&#8217;ll probably want to use WiX unless maintaining installers is your primary job responsibility or your company has sufficiently deep pockets for a good commercial tool.</p>

			The Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This week, I was guilty of the dark side of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger Effect</a>.  It&#8217;s not a universal truth, but it does describe a very real phenomenon that we&#8217;re all guilty of from time to time.  This happens when an unskilled or incorrect person is overly-confident in their own ability, while highly-competent individuals doubt their own ability.</p>
<p>Good thing it&#8217;s not a universal truth, or else we&#8217;d all get stuck in an infinite loop: &#8220;I doubt myself, therefore I must in fact be perfect.  I think I&#8217;m perfect, therefore I must doubt myself.  I doubt myself&#8230;&#8221;  Since that train of thought isn&#8217;t useful, the practical result of the Dunning-Kruger Effect is that <strong>any extreme confidence should be treated as a sign that we aren&#8217;t trying hard enough to improve.</strong>  When you <em>don&#8217;t</em> react to your own confidence by seeking out areas for improvement, you doom yourself to stagnate.  That would my worst nightmare come to life (aka the Freddy-Krueger Effect).</p>
<p>This time around, I had false-confidence around a series of refactorings I applied to <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley">Parsley</a> about a year ago.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by setting the scene.  Parsley is a tool for working with complex text patterns, when a single regex is insufficient.  You describe what a successful input looks like by breaking down the overall pattern into several smaller, named patterns called grammar rules.  For instance, if you want to <a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley/blob/2d113754b6e3e68a43e624987fb7ed5c4dd99870/src/Parsley.Test/IntegrationTests/Json/JsonGrammar.cs">describe JSON documents with Parsley</a>, you could define rules named True, False, Null, Number, Quotation, Array, and Dictionary.  All these grammar rules are described in terms of the <em>tokens</em> of JSON, the tiniest substrings that still have meaning to a JSON parser: things like keywords, operators, numeric literals, and string literals.</p>
<p>Some tokens are defined with simple string literals:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392649.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Some tokens are defined with simple regexes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392659.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Lastly, some tokens are defined with nontrivial, multilined regexes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392669.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>An important design goal here was to allow users of Parsley to define their regexes under a technically-untrue assumption: you get to pretend that your regex is being applied to the <em>start</em> of a potentially-long string.  You are trying to tell Parsley how to &#8220;peel off&#8221; the next few characters from the raw input.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s how it actually worked, though, we&#8217;d be stuck with performing wasteful substring operations: after matching a regex against the front of a million-character string just to peel off the first few characters, you <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> want to actually perform a nearly-million-character substring operation just to represent progress through the input.  Multiplying that waste by the number of tokens you&#8217;d eventually peel off of the original million characters, the waste would add up quickly.  So, I took advantage of some special regex options as well as a &#8220;\G&#8221; modifier, allowing me to compare your given regex against the input, <em>starting at whatever input position I feel like.</em>  I didn&#8217;t want the consumer to care about these details, so I wrote the TokenRegex class to hide these details:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392684.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Excellent!  You can provide simple regexes intended to match the <em>start</em> of a given input, and I modify the pattern so that I can in-fact match at <em>any</em> position we&#8217;ve progressed to.  <strong>Man, am I awesome or what?</strong></p>
<p>Introducing this class <em>was</em> a good idea.  It dramatically simplified the regexes that consumers needed to provide, and sufficiently abstracted away the details and reasoning behind this rarely-used &#8220;\G&#8221; regex modifier.  This refactoring was also a part of a larger refactoring effort, which has also been successful.  I wanted to make it so that you didn&#8217;t <em>have</em> to use all of the moving parts Parsley provides: if you needed a smarter tokenizer, such as one to deal with Python-style indentation, that was ok: I provided useful interfaces to let you hook in your own code for that kind of customization.  TokenRegex was supposed to help you further by isolating all the regex stuff from the rest of the system; if the Pattern class wasn&#8217;t good enough for your needs, you could provide your own and still leverage TokenRegex while doing so.</p>
<p>This week, fellow-Headspringer <a href="https://coderwall.com/ChrisMissal">Chris Missal</a> made a simple request: &#8220;What are your thoughts on giving parsley the ability to match tokens with a case insensitive regex?&#8221;</p>
<p>Armed with all the undeserved confidence in the world, I first replied that I already provided the right hooks for exactly that kind of customization: simply see class A, create a similar class B implementing the same interface while using a case-insensitive regex instead.</p>
<p><strong>Oh. Wait. No. That doesn&#8217;t actually work.</strong>  Not so awesome, afterall.</p>
<p>Even though the entire effort last year was to provide hooks for <em>exactly</em> this sort of customization, my TokenRegex abstraction was working against me.  I had created it in order to hide the use of the &#8220;\G&#8221; regex modifier as well as the convenient RegexOptions.Multiline option, which had the unintended consequence of <em>also</em> hiding the RegexOptions argument from the consumer.  Chris wants to include RegexOptions.IgnoreCase, but I&#8217;m preventing that for no good reason.  It&#8217;s fine that the current behavior is the <em>default</em>, but it shouldn&#8217;t be the <em>only</em> option.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/plioi/parsley/commit/c33c63bf870253be503f900482a6d3a65f50180a">The fix was to update the TokenRegex constructor to optionally accept additional RegexOption values</a>, and to allow those new constructor arguments to be supplied by the consuming project:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392698.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>From now on, if I get a feature request on an open-source project, I should never have a knee-jerk reaction of &#8220;It already does that due to my infinite foresight.&#8221;  Rather, I should go on the assumption that I really have left out or hidden something useful, and see what I can learn in the process.</p>

		<p>At Headspring, we’re proud to have amazing leaders who are experts in the industry. Jimmy Bogard, our Technical Architect, not only excels at Headspring but also enthusiastically participates in the global development community. He recently went on a “world tour” to teach and meet developers in Ireland, England and Ukraine.  Jimmy had the opportunity to speak to the following groups. For more information about what information was presented at each event, <a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/12/17/dublin-alt-net-skills-matter-kiev-alt-net-slides-code/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the way we program is universally similar, it’s interesting to think about how similar and different developers are around the world. Here’s what Jimmy had to say about his experience:</p>
<p><em>“One of the insights I found consistent in conversations from all the developers is that it seems that no matter where I go, the problems and passions remain the same. Everyone&#8217;s smart, everyone&#8217;s passionate, and the things developers’ care about are similar everywhere. We read the same blogs, books, and even use the same gadgets (when we can afford them). The only global issue was whether to code in English. People don&#8217;t pick English just because an American or Brit is on the team.  What if there are Ukrainians, French or Danes on the same team? The common language is English. We have a hard enough time picking a programming language, but picking a spoken language is even more interesting!”</em></p>

			Calm-Driven Development</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Years ago, when I was young and crazy, the tail end of a long-term project would be rushed and hectic.  A seemingly arbitrary deadline would approach, and despite (or because of) everyone putting in long hours, the remaining work would far exceed the amount of time left.  Major features would still be in active development, QA would find serious bugs left and right, and there seemed to be no hope. (To be clear: the blame falls on me as much as anyone.)</p>
<p>This week, the team I&#8217;ve been working with for a year is wrapping up a large project.  Over the last several weeks, everybody&#8217;s stress level has visibly <em>lessened</em>.  The urgency of incoming tasks has lessened, the backlog is being evaluated for risk versus reward, but truly-important issues are rightly being called out and divided among the team.</p>
<p>Contrasting this year&#8217;s experience with older, troubled projects, here are the things that appear to account for the difference:</p>
<h2>Sustainable Pace</h2>
<p>Headspring sticks to a 40-hour work week, and everyone on the org chart takes that seriously.  I&#8217;ve worked long hours in the past, and somewhere around hour 43 I start to produce poor work; really awful stuff which would inevitably spill into following weeks.  Recharging at this pace is both easy and necessary.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re facing death marches, it can often feel like it is out of your control.  Both you and those setting deadlines may feel like putting in extra hours is the only &#8216;lever&#8217; you can pull.  Consider, though, where the deadline pressure is coming from.  For instance, it may be that some vital core functionality needs to be in production to coincide with a marketing push, or to integrate with a third party&#8217;s own timetable.  The death march pressure you experience might just be intended to alleviate fears that the <em>vital parts</em> will miss their due date.  If you can then alleviate those fears through other, more sustainable means, death march pressure and long hours may stop feeling quite so necessary.  These alternatives may include frequent demos of recent progress on vital features, frank discussions of feature and defect priorities, and raising issues as early as possible.  When both sides are in on all this information, both sides have more levers to pull.</p>
<h2>Consistent Estimation</h2>
<p>This actually goes hand in hand with keeping a sustainable pace.  When you are overworked and asked to give reliable estimates for 100 tasks spread out over the next 3 months, you&#8217;re tempted to take the number of workday hours in 3 months and divide that by 100.  Surely it&#8217;ll be wrong, but you&#8217;ll make it all up on the weekend, right?  By <em>having</em> to succeed while sticking to a 40 hour week, my estimates have gotten far more accurate, even when estimates are expected in terms of hours rather than some other measurement like relative complexity.  Sometimes I&#8217;m a little over, sometimes I&#8217;m a little under, but once I was exposed to this particular project for a while, it became easier and easier to get extremely accurate with my estimates.  My estimates now <em>mean</em> something that stakeholders can rely on, and the gentle pressure of sticking to 40 hours helped to retrain my brain.</p>
<h2>Write. Down. Everything.</h2>
<p> In past projects, my approach to note-taking was unorganized.  On this project, I&#8217;ve gotten better about this, and it has paid off: I don&#8217;t waste time rediscovering information, from day to day and from month to month.  See <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/memory-management/">Memory Management</a> for more on my new note-taking habits.</p>
<h2>The End of the World/Project</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a little surprised to find that all the most-evident parts to our success don&#8217;t even get into <em>technical</em> concerns.  Of course, technical details are always involved in a single day&#8217;s thousand little decisions, but when talking about the health of such a long project with so many contributors, <em>human</em> concerns dominate success.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Men#Overview">The world may very well end with a bang today.</a>  Only the ancient Mayans and Neil deGrasse Tyson know for sure.  This project, on the other hand, ends with not even a whimper.  It&#8217;s not grand, and it&#8217;s not exciting.  It&#8217;s downright boring, and that&#8217;s quite a step forward.</p>

</address>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Windows Installer is Actually A Feature</h2>
<p>Something many Windows users are unaware of is that there is actually a feature in Windows called &#8220;Windows Installer&#8221;.  You won&#8217;t find it listed in Programs and Features in the Control Panel, but its included in the same way as a feature almost all Windows users have encountered (and cursed) called Windows Update.  You can see a release history and the default version shipped with the various Windows operating systems <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa371185.aspx">here.</a></p>
<h2>Basic Features</h2>
<p>Windows Installer has a number of features that make it attractive to use.  The foremost is transactional operations:  if an error occurs while installing (or uninstalling) your software, Windows Installer is able to rollback all of the changes made so far and revert the computer back to its state before the operation began.  This means the system will never be left in a half installed state.</p>
<p>Also highly useful is the capability to add Start menu, quick launch, and Desktop shortcuts for the users to easily start your software.</p>
<p>Another feature is the ability to do repairs.  Imagine a user is trying to free up disk space on their hard drive and unwittingly deletes some of your application files.  Windows Installer provides a mechanism that allows an installed program to be repaired, where any missing files are replaced.</p>
<p>Windows Installer also has a number of capabilities to control file sprawl and minimize disk usage.  With plummeting storage costs these capabilities aren&#8217;t as important as they once were, but if your application is very large then they&#8217;re still useful.  Windows Installer can track versions of your application and perform in place upgrades and patches so a user doesn&#8217;t have to completely install the entire application (which could take a long time if the application has a lot of physical files).  On demand install allows features of an application to appear available, but they aren&#8217;t actually installed on the machine until used, saving disk space.</p>
<h2>Custom Actions</h2>
<p>One very compelling ability is custom actions.  Custom actions can be written in C++, C#, and others and invoked in the middle of your install.  This allows you to add any sort of capability you need to have during the middle of the install process.  There are several caveats to go along with this power however.  First, make sure you&#8217;re not baking in some sort of setup that will need to be run outside the installer as a normal maintenance operation.  Second, sometimes what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish might not be worth the effort to make a custom action when it can be done in normal application code.  I&#8217;m not saying to never use custom actions, but just be careful not to turn them into a golden hammer to drive in everything, including screws.</p>
<h2>Other Advanced Features</h2>
<p>There are a plethora of other features aimed at big enterprises that are worth a passing mention.  Administrative install allows a network admin to  &#8221;install&#8221; onto on a network share location, and then users can install the application from that network share.  This allows the admin to ensure that users get the application installed in a consistent manner, reducing maintenance time.  Windows Installer can also be used to perform unattended installs so that an application can be pushed and installed in an automatic fashion, saving IT staff from having to make the rounds of hundreds or thousands of desks.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>You can see a fairly comprehensive list of the features <a title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa367449(v=vs.85).aspx" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa367449(v=vs.85).aspx">here</a>.  You&#8217;re probably not going to avail yourself to all of the more advanced functionality, but many of the simpler benefits (transactional operations, shortcuts, custom actions, and repairs) are a big win for a local Windows client application.</p>

<h2>What Kinds of Software Projects Benefit From an Installer?</h2>
<p>So you&#8217;ve invested in creating a Windows application of some kind and you&#8217;re ready to distribute it so others can use it.  Maybe that means making it available for sale to millions of outside people, or perhaps it means handing it off to your IT administrator.  How are the finished bits going to get to a place they can be used?</p>
<p>If your software is a client application that will live locally on the user&#8217;s computer (think Microsoft Office or the latest version of Halo), you should very seriously consider creating an installer.  Back in the days of DOS and the Soviet Union the operating system was little more than a shell over a file system and the user had to explicitly go find and tell the computer to run your application.  Windows provides a start menu with a list of all the programs a user can run, and at a minimum you probably want to add entries so your users can easily find and run the software once it&#8217;s on their system.</p>
<p>On the other hand if your software is a web application then there probably isn&#8217;t going to be much benefit to creating an installer.  The installation is theoretically going to be done by a tech savvy individual that will be configuring the web server initially, and upgrades usually just mean copying newer files into the site directory.  The benefit of creating an installer for this process is rarely going to be exceed the cost.  This doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t /automate/ the upgrade process.  Most Headspring projects are configured to be deployed automatically by a continuous integration server to eliminate rote error prone activity, and very large web applications (think Netflix) usually are deployed by automatically creating a virtual machine image using tooling such as Puppet, Chef, or VMWare with the application.</p>
<h2>Why Should I Bother?</h2>
<p>Why should you go through the effort of creating an installer for your Windows client application?  Lots of developer tools are distributed as a zip file that contains the software, and it&#8217;s up to the person downloading it to place it on their file system somewhere and find it whenever they want to run it - what&#8217;s wrong with that?</p>
<p>Installers make software accessible to casual users who might not know what to do with a zip archive.  Even if the target demographic is power users, it still makes their life easier to provide them with an installer that adds start menu entries for them.</p>
<p>Installers also allow you to ensure that certain tasks or setup activities take place by running custom actions as part of the install, minimizing the chance your application gets configured incorrectly before your client starts using it.</p>
<p>There are other less tangible but still very real benefits as well.  An installer projects a professional image of your application.  This is your users first impression of your application, and having an installer silently says &#8220;this is a polished project&#8221;.</p>

			Gizmos That Should Be on Your Wish List This Holiday!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At this point in the holiday season, you may be scrambling for gift giving ideas.  Who better than tried and true techies to weigh in on the must-have gadgets for the New Year. Scoop them up for someone you love or put them on your wish list!  Here are some ideas from the Headspring Development team.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse </strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Jimmy Bogard</em><strong></strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6272" title="atmafrontcurvedfy111" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/atmafrontcurvedfy111-395x300.jpeg" alt="" width="395" height="300" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/arc-touch-mouse" target="_blank">Arc Touch Mouse by Microsoft</a> is a sleek, wireless, and reliable tool that will improve the fluidity of work. It features the high-tech Touch strip technology that makes use precise. A fringe benefit for business and pleasure travel is the mouse can be flattened for easy storage!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arduino Microcontroller</strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Sharon Cichelli</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6273" title="300px-Arduino316" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/300px-Arduino316.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="209" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino microcontroller</a> is a great introduction to programming and electronics. Designed to be affordable and approachable, it opens the door for inspiring the next generation of developers.  It’s also great for building cool stuff as you work on fun projects with your sweetie or kids. It is open-source hardware supported by open-source software and a rich community of tinkerers who are happy to share their knowledge and get you started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kindle Paperwhite</strong></p>
<p><em>Suggested by Anne Epstein</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6274" title="MG_7921-660x439" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MG_7921-660x439-451x300.jpeg" alt="" width="451" height="300" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Touch-light/dp/B007OZNZG0" target="_blank">newest version of Kindle</a>, the “world’s most advanced e-reader,” features: higher resolution, higher contrast touchscreen, built-in light and an 8-week battery life. An improved screen, the ability for nighttime reading, and Amazon’s expansive e-book selection makes the Kindle Paperwhite a sought-after gadget this holiday!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What’s on your wish list this holiday?</strong></p>
