			Strongly Typed Whiteboarding</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last week, I announced the start of a <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/insufficiently-round-wheels/">new open source project, a test framework named Fixie</a>.  This week, we&#8217;ll see how to mitigate technical risks during the early days of such a project.  In short, you do the hard work first.</p>
<p>When starting a new project, it&#8217;s easy to spend all of your time thinking about what success looks like: the awesome features you have in mind, all working together in perfect harmony, with code so clean there&#8217;s just no room for bugs.  However, there are all kinds of reasons a project could fail, and these reasons include the possibility of a technical obstacle turning the project into a nonstarter.  Early on, you&#8217;ve got to put on your Pessimist Hat and think,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What is the biggest technical challenge that, if unsolved, would make the rest of the effort worthless?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Identify the Deal Breaker</h2>
<p>The 10,000 foot view of my plans for Fixie include the following features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Low-ceremony test fixture class discovery by default.</li>
<li>Low-ceremony test case discovery by default.</li>
<li>Simple test fixture lifecycle by default.</li>
<li>A console runner you could invoke from a build script.</li>
<li>Integration with TestDriven.NET.</li>
<li>Slick customization of the defaults: fixture discovery, case discovery, and fixture lifecycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two are easy: I basically accomplished that when I <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/low-ceremony-xunit/">customized xUnit</a> a while back.  I&#8217;m similarly not concerned about making a simple fixture lifecycle either, since I&#8217;ve used enough reflection to be comfortable instantiating a given Type, invoking methods on that Type, and the like.  The console runner will be a relatively small wrapper around that foundation.  Slick customization is a big, fancy feature I&#8217;d love to get to, <em>but utter failure there isn&#8217;t a deal breaker</em>.  I&#8217;d still want to use this on my own projects even if I could only leverage the simple defaults.</p>
<p>The deal breaker here is actually integration with TestDriven.NET.  Sometimes I use the ReSharper runner because it does a better job of running tests under the debugger, but GUI runners are usually overkill.  I use TD.NET because it&#8217;s simple, fast, and just fits my daily routine better.  I wouldn&#8217;t want to use Fixie on my other projects if it meant having to give up on TD.NET.  Fortunately, I found that it can work with third-party test frameworks.</p>
<h2>Create a Proof of Concept</h2>
<p>I decided that I needed to see a successful proof of concept for integration with TD.NET, before working on anything else.  It didn&#8217;t need to actually run any tests.  It just needed to prove that I could reach my own code in a meaningful way via TD.NET&#8217;s keyboard shortcuts.  Success means hitting TD.NET&#8217;s shortcut in Visual Studio, reaching my own code as a result, and then witnessing the expected output written by TD.NET.</p>
<p>I made a throw-away Solution for this proof of concept.  I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, I was sure I&#8217;d make a bit of a mess along the way, and I didn&#8217;t want to feel any irrational pressure to keep that kind of code around as a starting point for the real thing.  I wrote one to throw away, and the key here is <em>knowing</em> this was the one to throw away.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was better than a whiteboard sketch, in that I got real feedback from the IDE at every step, but it was weaker than regular development.  All the planning and whiteboard diagrams in the world would have been irrelevant as soon as fingers met keyboard, so I dove into the implementation with the intent to learn from the activity and to discard the code afterwards.</p></blockquote>
<p>The throw-away Solution contained two projects.  The first project represented the fake implementation of my test framework&#8217;s TD.NET plugin.  The second project represented the test cases within a hypothetical consumer project.  The goal here was not to make a working plugin, but instead to prove to myself that the TD.NET integration would be technically feasable.  I wanted to discover how TD.NET behaved as I implemented that integration from scratch.</p>
<p>First, I left the fake plugin project <em>empty</em> and populated the sample consumer with a single fake test fixture:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5149250.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Before doing anything in the plugin project, I wanted to confirm the behavior of TD.NET in the case that NO test framework is in play at all.  Right-clicking on the MyTestCase method and running it showed the following output:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5149257.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Oh, right.  TD.NET has a convenient feature that it can run methods even if they are not officially recognized as test methods in a test fixture.  That can be useful to quickly try out a simple method during development, before you really have tests in place for it.  This behavior poses an interesting problem, though: <strong>how will I <em>know</em> when my proof of concept is actually being detected and used by TD.NET as a real test framework plugin?</strong></p>
<p>There are <strong>two</strong> aspects to ensuring that my proof of concept is actually playing nicely with TD.NET:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I have no test framework in play yet and I attempt to right-click the MyTestFixture class to run ALL of it, TD.NET thankfully complains: &#8220;The target type doesn&#8217;t contain tests from a known test framework or a &#8216;Main&#8217; method.&#8221;  Once I&#8217;m successful, I shouldn&#8217;t get this message anymore.</li>
<li>My initial implementation of the plugin will simply throw an exception of its <em>own</em>, surfacing in TD.NET&#8217;s output, in contrast to the above output.</li>
</ul>
<p>TD.NET includes a library, TestDriven.Framework.dll, which you can use to wire things up to your own test runner.  It contains an interface that you must implement for your plugin to be detected.  TD.NET plugs into Visual Studio to pick up on keyboard shortcuts and the like, then turns that into calls against this interface, allowing you to pick things up from there to do the actual work of running tests.</p>
<p>In the plugin project, I added a reference to TestDriven.Framework.dll and added the following class as a first pass:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5149264.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Since each method just throws an exception with a specific message, I&#8217;ll be able to prove to myself whether or not TD.NET actually found and executed the plugin.  I made the sample consumer project reference the plugin project, and attempted to run the sample test method and test fixture: no dice.  The results were the same as having no test framework in play at all!</p>
<p>There was another piece to the puzzle.</p>
<p>The TD.NET blog explains how to complete the detection of custom test runners: <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/archive/2009/11/05/testdriven-net-2-24-xcopy-deployable-test-runners.aspx">XCopy Deployable Test Runners</a>.  Over in the plugin project, I added a text file named TestDrivenPoc.dll.tdnet:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5149267.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In Solution Explorer, I set this text file to &#8220;Copy Always&#8221;.  Now, when I rebuild the solution, the consumer gets a copy of this file right beside the similarly named DLL.  (When it comes time to deploy this to users, I&#8217;ll need to be sure to include this file along with the DLL.)  When running MyTestCase or MyTestFixture, we now see the exception thrown by our fake test framework&#8217;s TD.NET integration:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5149272.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5149273.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Fantastic!  These exceptions prove that TD.NET was able to find our plugin and call methods on it, instead of the default behavior we saw when there was no test framework in place.</p>
<p>To sum up, when creating a test framework that needs to integrate with TD.NET:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference TestDriven.Framework.dll.</li>
<li>Implement TestDriven.Framework.ITestRunner.</li>
<li>Include a *.tdnet text file whose name matches the test framework&#8217;s DLL, and whose contents identify the plugin&#8217;s DLL and ITestRunner class. (In my case, these two DLLs were one and the same.)</li>
<li>Consumers must reference the test framework and must have the *.tdnet file present.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Eliminate Any Remaining Risks</h2>
<p>Part of the interface strikes me as odd.  Note how in the sample successful output above, we hit &#8220;RunMember&#8221; after telling TD.NET to run a single test method <strong>and</strong> after telling it to run a whole test fixture class.  I would use the word &#8220;member&#8221; to describe a method-belonging-to-a-class, but using &#8220;member&#8221; to describe a whole class surprised me.</p>
<p>I was unsure of how to really implement RunMember(&#8230;), so I wasn&#8217;t finished with the proof of concept.  With a little trial and error, I fleshed out just enough of this method to see how you can tell the difference between single-test-method execution versus whole-test-fixture execution:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5149277.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This implementation determines whether we are running a test method or a test fixure, announces that fact in the output, and then reports success since we&#8217;re still just faking test execution.  In writing this method, I learned that MemberInfo, part of the .NET reflection API, can be used to describe class members as well as classes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The awkward wording in the TD.NET interface is in fact due to awkward naming in the .NET Framework.  I&#8217;ll want to be sure to avoid letting that complexity leak out into my own API.  Bad naming can spread like a disease.  If it posed an obstacle to my understanding ITestRunner, it would pose a similar obstacle to anyone reading Fixie&#8217;s implementation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, when I attempt to run my sample tests at the method or class level, I get the expected output:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5149279.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<h2>Set the Proof of Concept Aside</h2>
<p>This is a proof of concept.  I don&#8217;t actually want this code in my real Solution.  Now that I have these notes handy, it can <em>and should</em> be discarded.  I&#8217;ll grow the real implementation with more care when I&#8217;m ready to implement it.  With a little strongly-typed whiteboarding, I&#8217;ve removed the largest risk to the project and can feel free to proceed.</p>
<p>Next week, we&#8217;ll cover the nuts and bolts of setting up a new project from scratch, covering Fixie&#8217;s initial set of commits.</p>

			Insufficiently Round Wheels</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When Sharon Cichelli started the <a href="http://austin.polyglotprogrammers.org">Polyglot Programmers of Austin</a>, she created the meeting format around learning-by-teaching: one of the best ways to become an expert at something is to start teaching others about it.  Surely you&#8217;ll make some glorious mistakes along the way, but you&#8217;ll be motivated to constantly fill in the gaps of your knowledge in order to keep up with yourself and your audience.</p>
<p>My weekly blog posts over the past year and a half have served the purpose of learning-by-teaching, but the subject matter has always been random.  One thing that has made this effort difficult is that my current open source projects are a little esoteric.  It&#8217;s too difficult to write an article of the form, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a problem I ran into and here&#8217;s how I solved it,&#8221; as these projects require too much background explanation each time.</p>
<p>To motivate better learning-by-teaching, I&#8217;d like to take on a new experiment: developing a new open source project from scratch, documenting my approach here each week.  To keep the material focused and more generally useful, I&#8217;ll be selecting a project that most software developers are at least familiar with.  I want to work on something immediately <em>recognizable</em>, so that we all know what success will look like at each step, yet complex enough that the engineering challenges will match those we all find on real world projects.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to reinvent a familiar wheel, but that&#8217;s okay.  The more I look at this wheel, the more I think it really could benefit from being reinvented.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goals of this project are not limited to delivering the software.</p>
<p>My public goal for this series of articles is to help any developer feel confident that they, too, can start a new open source project.  We&#8217;ll cover things like attacking the hard problems first, prototyping, build scripts, bootstrapping, dogfooding, and publishing your work for everyone to use.  Along the way, we&#8217;ll surely run into some interesting engineering challenges, too.</p>
<p>My personal goals are twofold.  First, I want to become a better software developer, and that takes practice.  Second, I want to become better at helping others to become better software developers.</p>
<p>Documenting my progress as I go along is just an extension of the open source point of view.  Not only will the <em>source</em> be open source on GitHub, but the <em>process</em> will be open source here in these articles.</p>
<h2>The Wheel</h2>
<p>In case I haven&#8217;t been clear enough, I want to pick a problem that is <em>extremely</em> familar to software developers, but one that is nontrivial to implement.  Also, in order to add something new to the mix, it should be a problem whose state of the art has basically stagnated and could benefit from a refresh.</p>
<p>The insufficiently round wheel I&#8217;d like to reinvent is the unit test framework.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Seriously?</strong> Yes.<br />
<strong>No, really.</strong> Yes.<br />
<strong>Those have been around forever.</strong> You could say the same thing about music or turducken, but we&#8217;ve only really started to get those right in the last few years.<br />
<strong>But Patrick, that is a sufficiently round wheel and you shouldn&#8217;t be reinventing the wheel.  Do something cool instead!</strong> First, all &#8220;reinventing the wheel&#8221; remarks shall be met with a friendly &#8220;That&#8217;s kind of the point,&#8221; followed by a not-so-friendly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRiiiKA1xUI#t=13s">EPIC EYE-ROLL</a>.  Second, I think we really can add something cool to the mix.</p>
<p>If you must, think of it as a big code review of the current state of the art, followed by some advice on building <em>any</em> old open source project you have in mind.
</p></blockquote>
<h2>NUnit and xUnit: Constructive Criticism</h2>
<p>I have happily used NUnit for several years on several projects.  I&#8217;m using it on my current project at Headspring.  It&#8217;s excellent.  Use it.  I have happily used xUnit for several years on several projects.  I&#8217;m using it on my current open source projects.  It&#8217;s excellent.  Use it.</p>
<p>Still, these are complex systems, so there is always room for constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>NUnit has a complex test fixture lifecycle.</strong>  You can have code run before and after each fixture, and before and after each test case.  You specify these setup and teardown actions via [Attributes].  One instance of your fixture class is constructed and shared across the test cases, in order to support the fixture-level setup and teardown.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve run into a lot of frustrating surprises with this lifecycle.  First, I couldn&#8217;t tell you exactly how these attributes behave in the presence of inheritance (in fact, I believe the rules changed a few times throughout the history of NUnit).  Second, I have seen this behave differently across different <em>test runners</em>.  It&#8217;s pretty jarring to find your SetUp methods blatantly ignored.  <strong>The lifecycle is complex.  I lack control over it, and I lack insight into it when things go weird.</strong></p>
<p>xUnit was a reaction to NUnit, and it has a much simpler fixture lifecycle.  You get one instance of the fixture class <em>per test case</em>, a regular constructor is used for setup, a regular Dispose() is used for teardown, and if you really really want fixture state, you can still do that using an interface dedicated to that purpose.  I like the simplicity of using already-available language concepts like constructors and interfaces for these lifecycle steps.  I never get confused when my xUnit fixture classes take part in inheritance.</p>
<blockquote><p>I find that when fixture-wide state is downplayed like it is in xUnit, <em>I don&#8217;t miss it at all</em>.  When I use NUnit, on the other hand, I use [TestFixtureSetUp] all the time.  Once you open the door to a little complexity, vagabonds and feral cats are free to walk right in.</p></blockquote>
<p>xUnit is meant to be more customizable with regard to how fixtures and test cases are discovered, but <strong>the means of customization is opinionated</strong>.  I&#8217;ve had some success customizing xUnit in the past, but I ran into two problems: I still had to put an attribute on each of my fixture classes, and the means of customization is an <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/low-ceremony-xunit/">ISP violation</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, so it was a little hard to customize, buy why is it bad that I still had to put an attribute on my fixture classes?  I actually have a use case in mind for one of my other projects, in which some test fixtures would originate from folders of plain text files rather than C# classes.  If my fixture isn&#8217;t also a class, <em>where do I put xUnit&#8217;s required class attribute</em>?  <strong>I want to have total control over the means of discovering test fixtures and test cases.</strong></p>
<h2>Degrees of Freedom</h2>
<p>Regardless of the test framework I use, I use the Should assertion library.  Its creator recognized that assertion libraries have no business being tied to a single test framework.  Once that concept was plucked out of the test framework&#8217;s responsibilities, developers gained an extra degree of freedom: you can change your assertion library without having to change your test framework, and you can change your test framework without having to change your assertions.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m thinking about switching to Shoudly.  <a href="http://shouldly.github.com/">Its error messages are amazing.</a>  How does that even <em>work</em>!?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ensuring the freedom to make changes is vital to successful software development, which raises an important question: if assertion libraries have no business being a part of a test framework, and plucking them out gives us a new degree of freedom, then what <em>else</em> are test frameworks mistakenly doing which should <em>also</em> be plucked out?</p>
<h2>Fixie</h2>
<p>Aside from providing reasonable defaults, I think that test frameworks have no business owning test fixture discovery, test case discovery, or the test fixture lifecycle.  The reasonable defaults should be enough for the 90% of use cases, but it should get completely the heck out of my way for the other 90%.</p>
<p>If we pluck those responsibilities out, what&#8217;s left?  Test frameworks should only do the monotonous parts: orchestration of test execution, deferring to you for advice on discovery/lifecycle decisions, accumulating results, and reporting those results to whatever test runner is in play.  It should include a console test runner at a minimum, but test running should also be available as a library so that other runners like a GUI runner, ReSharper plugin, TestDriven.NET runner, or the like could be developed independently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to announce <a href="https://github.com/plioi/fixie">Fixie</a>, a test framework with the goals of having low-ceremony defaults, and extra degrees of freedom around the test lifecycle.  We&#8217;ll see this project grow here over the next few months.</p>
<blockquote><p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle">fixie</a> is what you get when you start with a bike and remove everything that isn&#8217;t a bike.  I want Fixie to be what&#8217;s left when you start with a test framework and remove everything that isn&#8217;t a test framework.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Low-ceremony defaults:</strong> No required attributes, no required inheritance.  A test fixture is a class in your test assembly whose name ends in Tests.  A test case is any public method in one of those classes.  I will likely include an answer to NUnit&#8217;s <a href="http://nunit.org/index.php?p=testCaseSource&r=2.6.2">[TestCaseSource]</a>, but only if I can keep it similarly low-ceremony.  Like xUnit, you&#8217;ll get one fixture instance per test case.</p>
<p><strong>Degrees of freedom:</strong>  If the defaults aren&#8217;t enough, I want you to be able to customize the test fixture and test case discovery steps, as well as customize the test fixture lifecycle itself.  Making this customization <em>easy</em> will be challenging, but fun.</p>
<p>Next week, we&#8217;ll tackle a proof-of-concept for the highest-risk requirement: the must-have integration with TestDriven.NET.</p>
