			Failure Leads to Success</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Anyone who has ever achieved success has also experienced failure. However, in the moment, we tend to see failure as a bad thing for several reasons, mostly because it is an unpleasant experience. Putting your heart and soul into reaching a goal or a desired result and falling short makes us feel inadequate. Although many may give up in the face of failure, it is those who remain persistent and determined who ultimately become successful in their mission. Throughout time, the most successful people weren’t the ones who just fell into success but those who experienced failure and worked through the mistakes and criticism to achieve success.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1944, young modeling hopeful Norma Jean Baker was told by the director of Blue Book Modeling Agency she should get secretarial work or get married. Norma Jean Baker later became a world-known pop cultural icon, Marilyn Monroe.</li>
<li>In 1954, an unknown performer was fired by the manager of the Grand Ole Opry who advised him to go back to driving a truck. This singer became the most popular singer in American history and left a legend as the “King of Rock and Roll,” but most know him as Elvis Presley.</li>
<li>In 1962, Decca Recording Company turned down a record deal with a band of four British musicians citing they were left unimpressed and disliked their sound. This group later became the international phenomenon known as The Beatles.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what changed for these people? What led them from failure to success? It wasn’t luck; it was acquired knowledge. They were, at the very least, able to eliminate one course of action in order to develop a new plan.</p>
<p>The greatest opportunity success through experiencing failure offers is knowledge. Most of us probably don’t remember learning to walk, but surely our parents do, and they can vouch that we didn’t get it right the first time we tried. Did we give up and continue to crawl? No. We tried again until we got it right. But not only did we try again, we practiced walking so much we were eventually able to run. We weren’t born knowing everything, but we were born with the ability to learn and grow. So, similarly when faced with challenges in our professional and personal life, if at first you don’t succeed, try again and continue to practice your skills so they become second nature to you.</p>
<p>So, success means gaining knowledge from a good, hard failure.  Open yourself to new situations by being vulnerable and exposed to criticism. Understand what it is that holds you back from success, embrace it as motivation and envision yourself in an ideal situation. Essentially, change what failure means to you and harness it as confidence to create further success.</p>
<p><em>All you need is ignorance and confidence and the success is sure.</em>  -<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/marktwain109620.html">Mark Twain</a></p>

			Best-Kept Secret: MS Word&#8217;s Selection Pane Saves Time, Reduces Frustration</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s probably because I never learned to play first-person shooters, but I have a devil of a time in Word selecting the element I want out of a page full of drawing shapes. Trying to select a text box, I click on what I think is that one-pixel box border, and end up selecting the canvas behind it, or a nearby rectangle, or nothing at all. Have you experienced this frustration? I&#8217;ve even resorted to &#8220;Send to Back&#8221; to get something out of my way so that I can select the thing I want.</p>
<p>I stumbled onto the solution. To explain it, I have made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1puMOp7d-kk">video demo of MS Word&#8217;s Selection Pane</a> feature.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1puMOp7d-kk</p>
<p>On the ribbon bar, select the Page Layout tab. Look within the Arrange group, towards the right, and click the Selection Pane button. That opens the Pane, which lists all drawing objects that are on the current page.</p>
<p>From the Selection Pane, you can easily click the name of the item you want, and that will select it. From there, you can change formatting options or adjust its position with your keyboard.</p>
<p>It brings some extra features, too. Click the eye image next to an item to hide and show it, similar to Photoshop. Drag items to reorder them, which changes their z-index, bringing items in front of others.</p>
<p>I was so delighted when I found that button. It changed my day from one of grumbling at my mouse to calling my coworkers over to show &#8216;em. Enjoy!</p>

			Can You Spare Some Change?</a>
	</h2>

		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/can-you-spare-some-change/credit-card-reader-for-android-smartphone" rel="attachment wp-att-2258"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2258 alignleft" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Credit-Card-Reader-for-Android-Smartphone-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve all been there… You are walking into the grocery store around the holidays and by the entrance are the familiar red kettle and the ringing bell. You would like to donate, <em>or maybe you wouldn’t</em>, but its 2011, who carries cash anymore?  Fact of the matter is, its 2011, debit and credit cards are the norm… Thus enter the “Square.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You haven’t seen this yet? Chances are that if you haven’t, you will be just as puzzled as me as to why this wasn’t created years ago. The “Square” is a peripheral device that connects to your smart phone via the headphone jack, and is designed to take payments from virtually anywhere. Pretty cool, huh? We will see…</p>
<p>I notice two fatal flaws with this technology that may cause a ruckus:</p>
<ul>
<li>I mentioned the red kettle and bell earlier, the approach this year is to allow Red Cross volunteers to take donations with this new technology. Predictions are that this new trend will grow for not just philanthropic organizations, but Girl Scout troops selling cookies, fundraisers, and of course small to big business. Will the ease of these debit/credit card transactions be a blessing or a curse? No longer can the excuse, “I don’t carry cash,” be used to avoid signing up for the magazine subscription that knocks on the front door. “I only carry credit cards,” can’t be a cop out for those that just don’t wish to buy or donate. I don’t believe that everyone who uses this line are dishonest - lying to avoid an unplanned transaction. But will this accessibility make it harder to opt out, ultimately taking away the ability to choose?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I really don’t have to go into much depth on the second flaw - security.  Would the use of the “Square,” be like leaving your front door open?  I don’t like to be cynical, but it’s a reality that needs to be addressed. How safe is the information transmitted from a stranger’s smart phone to the credit card vendor? Also, smart phones are connected to the world through wireless signals (the easiest signal to hack into). We should be cautious about trusting this technology the same way we trust Amazon to have our credit card information on file for future purchases.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is this a good thing or a bad thing? I do know one thing for sure, my wife won’t be happy when I come home with a $100 charge on the credit card and 20 boxes of thin mints.</p>

			Building Rich Enums</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Headspring has recently updated its open-source <a href="https://bitbucket.org/headspringlabs/enumeration">Enumeration</a> class. We recommend this as an alternative to using plain old .NET enums in your domain models. Most of the time, you use a .NET enum in order to define a finite set of named values. <code>Enumeration</code> serves that purpose too.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s so bad about enums? They provide a very thin abstraction over integers, and that abstraction is both leaky and insufficient when building a rich domain model.</p>
<h2>The .NET enum abstraction leaks</h2>
<p>When you define an enum, you are really defining several integer constants.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1375478.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Whether you declare the integers or not, each enum value is really an integer. Unfortunately, this means that unintended values are allowed:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1375483.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This is .NET&#8217;s way of reminding you of its own implementation details. -1 has nothing to do with the roles in my system. Enums fail to limit values to those I consider meaningful, so why am I using them as domain objects?</p>
<h2>The .NET enum abstraction is insufficient</h2>
<p>You can think of an enum definition as shorthand for a class. That class effectively inherits from int, exposing public static getters that return each defined constant, including convenience methods for converting to and from strings.</p>
<p>What if the shorthand just isn&#8217;t enough to describe the class we really wanted to write? What if your type deserves some additional methods, or you need to associate additional metadata with each value? You could resort to attaching metadata via attributes, and provide some extension methods to reflect on them, but that&#8217;s a long way to go to avoid admitting that we <em>really</em> just wanted to constrain our domain objects to a fixed set of values. It&#8217;s nice to use ints as the &#8216;unique identifier&#8217; for each value in the set, but we don&#8217;t need that int to be the <em>whole</em> story.</p>
<h2>Using Headspring&#8217;s Enumeration Class</h2>
<p>Using <code>Enumeration</code>, we could define a more useful set like so:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1375494.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Here we see a fixed set of objects, with the convenient int and string representations we&#8217;re used to having with enums. <code>Role.FromInt32(int)</code> allows you to load the value associated with a given int, such as when reading from a database, but only the fixed set of integers will be allowed. Each value can have arbitrary properties, and the enumeration can contain additional methods.</p>
<h2>Enumeration&#8217;s Generic Type Constraint</h2>
<p><code>Enumeration</code> contains an interesting generic constraint. Several of the methods on the base class need to deal with the type of the individual values, so <code>Role</code> is declared to implement <code>Enumeration&lt;Role&gt;</code>. You can think of the <code>Role</code> class as &#8220;passing&#8221; its own definition up to the base class so <code>Enumeration</code> can make use of it. Similarly, <code>Enumeration</code> needs to be declared in such a way that it can know what&#8217;s being &#8220;passed up&#8221; to it:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1375498.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>In other words, <code>Enumeration</code> will be working with any type that is itself declared as an <code>Enumeration</code>. This constraint basically mimics the &#8220;shape&#8221; of the first line of the <code>Role</code> type. Likewise, it <strong>demands</strong> that any child class be declared with a line of that shape.</p>
<p>At first, it may seem like <code>class Role : Enumeration&lt;Role&gt;</code> should result in a compiler error. It looks like we&#8217;re trying to <em>use</em> a type before we&#8217;re even finished <em>defining</em> it. The truth is, the compiler need only compare the &#8220;shape&#8221; of the two classes&#8217; declarations in order to convince itself that the required pattern is being respected, and <em>then</em> it can go on with the business of verifying the <em>content</em> of each class.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>.NET enums are still useful, such as when you need to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.flagsattribute.aspx">pack several bit flags into a single integer</a>, but when using them to define finite sets of objects in your domain model, their brevity and ubiquity may tempt you away from writing rich domain objects. When you reach for the handy dandy <code>enum</code> keyword, consider whether <code>Enumeration</code> is a better fit.</p>

			A Worthy Opponent</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/11/a-worthy-opponent/istock_000000673539small" rel="attachment wp-att-2240"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2240 alignleft" title="Bucking Bull" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/iStock_000000673539Small-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="207" /></a></p>
<p>Imagine that running a business is like riding a bull in a rodeo. The straps are wrapped tight around your hands. You grin, nod, and hold on for as long as you can.  The bull bucks furiously, and if it’s ornery enough, you’ll be thrown off just as soon as you mount.  If you get the choice, maybe you would like a tamer bull, not quite as mad, so you can stay on longer.  After all, the bull is your opponent, the battle is your business, and you want to win.</p>
<p>Let’s explore three reasons why you really want the mad bull:</p>
<ol>
<li>Achieving a harder challenge yields greater reward. The trick to this metaphor is that in a rodeo, your score is calculated both by how long you are able to stay on the bull and by your selected bull’s temperament.  A mean bull will buck you off early, but he is worth more points for the challenge.  What is the risk worth to you?  Take a gamble, and you may surprise yourself.</li>
<li>If you know your opponent will be tough, you’re more likely to prepare.  Preparing for an angry bull won’t just allow you to stay on the bull longer; it makes you a better bull rider.  Your training doesn’t disappear when the ride is over. You come out stronger and with more knowledge about how the bull moves.</li>
<li>A healthy match spurs the opportunity for both participants to innovate.  If you have ever interviewed someone, you have probably asked them “How did you face a tough situation?”  The answer you want to hear is something honest and creative.  You need to know how this person will innovate in a challenging situation, because innovation is valuable.  Discover for yourself a new technique for staying on a mad bull longer.  Change the game!</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can stay on the tamer bull for a really long time, and maybe you’ll earn enough points to win.  Maybe you’ll walk away with some money, a nice belt buckle, or a pat on the back. But no one will be surprised, no one will ask you how you did it, and no one will consider you “the one to beat”.</p>
<p>The moral of the metaphor is, don’t back down from a good fight.  Be as brave as your inner bull rider. Find an opponent that is worthy of you.</p>
<p>So which bull do you want?</p>
