	<h2 class="title">No Offshoring</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>One of Headspring&#8217;s principle practices - which is probably not advertised nearly to the extent it should be - is that we never outsource development work. The policy was put in place early in our company history. This was right around the time we steered away from building websites for new companies and began focusing our services on delivering custom enterprise software. Sometimes it made sense to outsource, and could be more cost effective for our customers. But more often than not, it became difficult to see around corners and ensure that we were receiving quality built code.</p>
<p>We discovered the best way to create or reconstruct our clients&#8217; software is to hire the best architects, critical thinkers and code masters we could get our hands on, put them in a room together, and give them the resources they need to do great work. We refer to this collaboration as a &#8220;brain trust&#8221;. And working this way has directly affected our ability to be so successful.</p>
<h2>Looks Can Be Deceiving</h2>
<p>This morning I woke up to <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/16/169528579/outsourced-employee-sends-own-job-to-china-surfs-web" target="_blank">a national news story</a> about a company entrusting critical development work to a pricey developer - only to find its deluxe development package was being outsourced to a Chinese team for 1/5 of their cost.</p>
<p>The story is quite funny, actually.  The company discovered data that showed its virtual network being accessed from China. The company feared hackers had invaded the network, so they ordered an investigation from Verizon&#8217;s web security team. The VPN logs showed the originally contracted developer, while still sitting at his desk, was also accessing the network from a city in China.</p>
<p>Now, it was understood in the office that this contract developer (<a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://securityblog.verizonbusiness.com/2013/01/14/case-study-pro-active-log-review-might-be-a-good-idea/" target="_blank">the original story published on Verizon&#8217;s blog refers to him as &#8220;Bob&#8221;</a>) did great work. In fact, he was regarded as the best developer in the office, and was paid accordingly - six figures, in fact.  But after a deeper investigation, the Verizon team discovered hundreds of .pdf files detailing Bob&#8217;s communication with the outsourced firm he worked with in Shenyang China. He subcontracted the firm for 1/5 of his pay.</p>
<p>So what did Bob do while his sub-contract was hard at work? Here&#8217;s his busy schedule:</p>
<p>9:00 AM - Arrive at the office, surf Reddit.com, watch cat videos</p>
<p>11:30 AM - Take lunch</p>
<p>1:00 PM - Ebay time!</p>
<p>2:00 - ish PM - Facebook and LinkedIn updates</p>
<p>4:30 PM - End of day email to management</p>
<p>5:00 PM - Go home</p>
<h2>Who Do You Love?</h2>
<p>As it turns out, this wasn&#8217;t Bob&#8217;s first rodeo, and he didn&#8217;t invent the wheel either. Sure, he <em>delivered</em> great code, so what&#8217;s the big issue in the end? It comes down to trust.</p>
<p>We hear the same stories all the time from our prospective clients - except not usually with the same storybook &#8220;no harm done&#8221; ending that Verizon outlines in their comical case study. Nope. Usually companies aren&#8217;t aware of the security breach until there is a big problem.</p>
<p>So do yourself a favor: make absolute sure you are working with a company/contractor/development team that cares about your security and code as much as you do.</p>
