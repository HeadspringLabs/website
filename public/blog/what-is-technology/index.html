	<h2 class="title">What Is Technology?</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/what-is-technology/frustrating-printer" rel="attachment wp-att-4418"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4418" title="frustrating printer" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/frustrating-printer.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="271" /></a>I have never met a printer I liked. They break all the time, they are buggy and noisy, and cartridges are way too expensive.</p>
<p>Printers are a terrible bane on my existence, and I have made a purpose to rid myself of needing them at all. I have come to realize that I am not alone in this grievance, and going on without the need for a frustrating printer is no longer a difficult task. Google Docs, EchoSign and a whole host of other cloud-based offerings have significantly reduced our reliance on printers, and they have added years back to my life.</p>
<p>But this post isn’t <em>all</em> about how much I hate printers – it’s old news. I work for a technology company, and technology is about new news.</p>
<p>This morning I heard about an exciting new branch of technology: 3D printing. It works - unlike regular printing - and instead of making a document, it makes an object. Recently a doctor in Belgium has worked with 3D printing to create a new jaw for an elderly patient. The jaw was literally molded together with a laser printer that heats small particles of titanium in layers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/what-is-technology/jaw-made-with-printer" rel="attachment wp-att-4419"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4419" title="jaw made with printer" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jaw-made-with-printer-300x167.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p>As I mentioned, cloud computing has changed the paper printing business as we know it, but some printing companies are willing to accept this new opportunity as a challenge to reinvent. The exciting technology in this story is not the artificial jaw. The technology is in using a 3D printer to make it.</p>
<p>The printing business is moving away from ink and paper to useable 3D objects, but they have the same message and mission: convenience. They are saving people from painful procedures which harvest bone and tissue from other parts of their body, and they are changing the landscape of artificial implant offerings to the medical community. Also, printing implants could be much cheaper than harvesting or manufacturing them. <em>That</em> is technology!</p>
<p>My point is, when it’s time to improve technology in business, or put technology in the classroom, or bring technology to nursing homes, we may not have to look very far. Overhead projectors and pocket calculators were once considered expensive technology. Be brave enough to look at what you have available. You don’t have to mask your problems with a new device. Why throw an iPad into the equation if it isn’t necessary? Instead, open yourself up to change. Look around and create technology first with people and processes.</p>
<p>So how tech savvy are you? What are some other examples of reinvented technology?</p>
