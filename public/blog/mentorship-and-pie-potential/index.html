<div class="entry-content"><p>This past summer, the Headspring staff took a trip to <a href="http://www.k1speed.com/austin-location.html">K1 Speed</a> for a quarterly meeting.  When we weren&#8217;t &#8220;testing the safety equipment&#8221; around the track, we were talking about our performance for the quarter as well as plans for the future.  We were asked to imagine a much larger Headspring 1-2 years out, and describe what it would take to get there.</p>
<p>I shared a hard truth, suggesting we start considering more recent grads in our hiring process.  This may seem counter-intuitive.  Hiring talented folks for software development is extremely tough, and real-world experience matters a lot when evaluating candidates, right?  On the flip side, though, most experienced software developers have a long list of horror stories from past jobs: office politics, bureaucracy, teams spread too thin, death marches, and the like.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be great, for both you and the new hire, if they got to skip all that luck-of-the-draw stuff and instead got <em>all</em> of their real-world experience at a healthy company right from the start?</p>
<p>From a candidate&#8217;s point of view, they could enter the workforce surrounded by experienced people who have already faced and rejected all those problems.  They could learn from everyone&#8217;s example far more quickly than they would otherwise on their own, and they wouldn&#8217;t run the risk of being set <em>back</em> by the examples of struggling teams.</p>
<p>In reaction to my suggestion, I was asked to take on a mentorship role with a current student, with the goal of preparing him for an internship here at Headspring.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way things work here: if you make a suggestion to improve things, don&#8217;t be surprised if <em>you</em> get to make it a reality.  In light of this policy, next time I think I should share another hard truth with the team: <strong>we need to be eating more cakes and delicious pies</strong>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve only been meeting for a few weeks, but it&#8217;s already a rewarding experience for both of us.  Once per week and for about an hour, Dan and I meet to bring him up the C# / MVC learning curve.  When we first met at a <a href="http://www.polyglotprogrammers.org/">Polyglot</a> meeting, Dan had some experience with C++ and Lua, but hadn&#8217;t worked with C# yet.  Our initial meetings have focused on the nuts and bolts of C# itself, but even early on we got to cover other topics such as automated testing, readability concerns, the DRY principle, etc.</p>
<p>On the selfish side of the equation, this experience helps me to improve my own skills.  Having to explain things that I take for granted forces me to challenge my own assumptions, and improves my ability to discuss complex technical subjects with clients.  On more than one occasion, Dan&#8217;s questions have left me initially thinking to myself, &#8221;<em>Why</em> exactly, do I feel so strongly about this opinion?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have appreciated having a mentor at that age, but filling the opposite role is looking to be a pretty sweet deal.  Not as sweet as my cake/pie suggestion, but sweet nonetheless.</p>
