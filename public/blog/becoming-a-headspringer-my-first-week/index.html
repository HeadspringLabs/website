<div class="entry-content"><h2 dir="ltr">Welcome Number 7941</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d like for you to take a moment and imagine that today is your first day at a new company.  You enter the building wearing the carefully selected slacks and shirt ironed the night before.  You&#8217;re filled with nervous energy, but confident, because out of the fifty plus candidates, who did they select to write their new custom software solution?  That&#8217;s right, you.</p>
<p>The friendly HR rep that recruited you shakes your hand and leads you to a large conference room where you attend a new hire orientation.  You&#8217;re promptly handed an employee handbook the size of a telephone book and sit down.  Opening to a random page on Computer/IT Usage policies you learn that it&#8217;s against company policies to look at **cough** questionable **cough** images on company computers.  Interesting, you think to yourself, I figured that was common knowledge.</p>
<p>Over the next four hours you listen to HR representatives speak about company history, company policies, and benefits.  You fill out form after form of information asking for social security numbers, driver&#8217;s license number, passport number and other private information.  You&#8217;re handed a badge with an employee number, 7941.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/04/becoming-a-headspringer-my-first-week/cubicle-hell" rel="attachment wp-att-4917"><img class="size-full wp-image-4917 aligncenter" title="Sea of Cubicles" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/cubicle-hell.jpg" alt="Sea of Cubicles" width="650" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>Next they take you on a tour of the office.  On the first floor is sales, marketing and HR.  On the second floor is Engineering.  At this point you&#8217;ve been blasted with so much canned information that mentally you only take note of the bathroom locations.</p>
<p>The elevator door opens on the third floor and your tour guide herds your group through the sea of Customer Service cubicles until you reach the IT department and HR hands you off to your new tour guide, your manager.  He or she introduces you to the entire team and leaves you in your cubicle.  Sitting down, you realize you don&#8217;t have a computer at your desk.  You think to yourself, what does a software developer do without a computer?</p>
<p>How many of you have a page, just like this, written in your life story?  How many of you have felt like a number, like you weren&#8217;t valued?  At Headspring, there’s a better way&#8230;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Four Core Values</h2>
<p>Let me start off by saying, at Headspring, things are different.  You quickly learn the following four core values are deeply held at the core of a Headspringer.</p>
<p>- Drive for Excellence<br />
- People are Valued<br />
- Honest Communication<br />
- Passion for Learning and Growth</p>
<p>Within the first week, time and time again I witnessed Headspringers demonstrating these four values in every interaction.  Let me take a few moments to detail just a few of them.<br />
A week before my start date I received a delivery of piping hot, freshly baked cookies from the founder and CEO, Dustin Wells.  Now I&#8217;m definitely not known to have a sweet tooth, but the cookies were just plain awesome; and seriously, how cool is that to have the owner of the company value me as a new hire?</p>
<p>Three business days before my start date, I received an email from the director of software development, Glenn Burnside.  I was the proud owner of a shiny new Headspring Google account.  Being a naturally curious person, I logged in to find ten or more introduction emails to various systems such as the Intranet, BitBucket repositories, and Agile Zen Projects.  Wow, I haven&#8217;t started yet and I&#8217;m already trusted with sensitive information such as the admin credentials to the production server.  This level of transparent communication across an organization was and still is amazing to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/04/becoming-a-headspringer-my-first-week/headstream094" rel="attachment wp-att-4918"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4918" title="Headspring Offices" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/headstream094.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="289" /></a></p>
<p>On my first day at the Headspring office I arrived to find my desk already outfitted with business cards, moleskine journals, a Headspring shirt, and most importantly a fully configured laptop with two 24&#8221; monitors.  When I say fully configured, I don&#8217;t mean it has RAM, a working Hard Drive and is plugged in.  I mean that it&#8217;s fully configured with almost every software development tool that I use, from TestDriven.Net to Notepad++ to Redgate SQL Toolbelt.  I only downloaded and installed the obscure tools that I use such as Beyond Compare, Wunderlist, gVim, and Cygwin.  By the end of the day, with guidance from teammates, I was up and running, tackling tasks in the backlog.</p>
<p>Four days into the new job and I had my first one-on-one meeting with Glenn.  Here we talked candidly about expectations and goals.  The conversation drifted towards the on ramp process and during that discussion he asked for my opinion and took a suggestion I had on the process.<br />
That&#8217;s when it hit me.  The four core values are a deep commitment at Headspring starting from the top leadership all the way down.  Glenn had taken something so simple like the on ramp process of a new employee and the drive for excellence had motivated everyone to thoughtfully deconstruct and improve the process.  This is what it means to be a Headspringer.</p>
<p>Working at Headspring has already been an amazing experience.  It&#8217;s a pleasure to work with individuals who have a deep passion and commitment to developing not only software, but each other.  So I feel compelled to ask you this question.  What&#8217;s keeping you from <a href="http://www.headspring.com/about-us/careers">applying</a>?</p>
