<div class="entry-content"><p>I was a teen of the 80s, and I have fond memories of that time in my life. The creation of MTV, fashion, music and even the TV shows I watched. However, others might view this as a time of bad hair, horrible fashion and terrible music. I lived through the Reagan Era and Challenger disaster and watched the Berlin Wall come down. I’m part of Generation X, those born around 1960-1976.</p>
<p>The newly conservative age group, 16 percent (about 50,000 people) of the U.S. population in 2009, that was concerned with creating successful futures for ourselves as they focused on college and careers took their world to new heights of material wealth and eventually personal stress. However, the shift in priorities from the social revolutions that captured the attentions of our counter-cultured parents of the baby boom generation also had a huge effect on family values.</p>
<p>My generation, Generation X, witnessed the divorce rate double as our parents embraced the concept as socially acceptable.<!--more--> The effects of social changes led Generation X to focus on careers first and families later. The new path in life, however, has led to a double-role situation unseen by previous generations. Generation X emphasized career first, and therefore, got married later and had children even later than all previous generations – I think I might have been the exception to this rule. I got married when I was in college. Now, many X’ers are busy taking care of their young children and spouses, as well as their parents who have grown old and need their help now, too.</p>
<p>Although I’m not at the point of needing to help my parents yet, I’ve seen and heard how becoming a parent to your parent can be an emotional wrenching process. According to an AARP study, an estimated 34 million Americans serve as unpaid caregivers for other adults, usually elderly relatives, and that they spend an average 21 hours a week helping out. In addition, millions more adult children are calling regularly, flying into town every few weeks or months or just stopping by to take Mom or Dad to the doctor. Also, there are big decisions that sometimes have to be made – from living arrangements, medical decisions, legal rights, etc. and all of this can have a strain on the family. Although most of us would view this as a minor sacrifice or no sacrifice at all, it still can have a physical, financial and emotional toll.</p>
<p>As a Gen X’er, I’ve been thinking more about how best to prepare for this – especially since my wife and I have both of our parents to worry about. Have you been planning? Are you currently in a dual-role of taking care of your family and your aging parents?</p>
<p>As for the mullet, well, isn’t it obvious why we stopped that trend?</p>
