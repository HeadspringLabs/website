    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The bags are packed and we’re ready to head out for Dallas Day of Dot NET.  We've heard through event organizers that over 500 people are expected to attend.  Woo Hoo!  Half of our team is going, including President, Jeffrey Palermo, sporting a fresh polo from his recently bestowed and 7<sup>th</sup> consecutive Microsoft MVP title.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/dallas-day-of-dot-net-get-nerdy-with-it/photo-2" rel="attachment wp-att-4036"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4036" title="Katie and Jeffrey heading to Dallas Day of Dot NET" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-2-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/03/dallas-day-of-dot-net-get-nerdy-with-it/photo-1" rel="attachment wp-att-4037"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4037" title="photo (1)" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-1-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>


<p>Obviously, we’re super excited about the main event:  keynote speaker Scott Hanselman.  Hanselman is well known for many things, most notably his evangelism for Microsoft and all things .NET.  His popular weekly podcast series <em>Hanselminutes</em> and blog <em>Scott Hanselman’s Computer Zen</em> will be the source of inspiration for his presentation titled <em>Making Your Blog Suck Less</em>.</p>


<p>The posted <a href="http://dallasdayofdotnet.com/dallasdayofdotnet/Home/Agenda">agenda</a> doesn’t include any abstracts. Lucky for you, a few Headspringers are presenting and provided me with their details:</p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Jeffrey Palermo: </strong><em>Developing for Business Intelligence</em></p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With Microsoft aligning several of its products to serve BI needs, .Net developers are left with little support for providing analytical answers from data stored in system databases.  Even reports are often just formatted query results on a screen.  Business intelligence is about deriving knowledge from your data, not just view raw data.  From fact tables to star schemas to methods of visualization, Visual Studio doesn't provide much support for these important and enabling concepts for BI.  This session will introduce developers to the fundamentals of BI development and the basic tools and techniques they can use to start extracting intelligence from their data.</p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Jimmy Bogard: </strong><em>Keeping Integration Sane with NServiceBus</em></p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Building apps used to be simple when we just needed to push data into a database. However, more and more we see our applications needing to communicate with other external applications via REST, SOAP, or for the less fortunate, flat files. We can assume these external services are always 100% up, but inevitably, someone trips over the cord and communication fails. Often, recovering from these kinds of failures are the hardest to recover from, causing developers and the business alike significant heartburn.</p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In this session we'll examine the common causes for failures integrating with other systems. We'll look at the basics of messaging and alternate UI interaction models to accommodate failure. Finally, we'll dig in to NServiceBus and see how NServiceBus kicks the problems of flaky integration to the curb once and for all.</p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Tim Thomas: </strong><em>Building Games with .NET and XNA Game Studio</em></p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em>Developing your own game can be a daunting task. In this session, you’ll see how easy it is to get started from scratch with XNA Game Studio 4.0, the latest version of Microsoft’s multi-platform game creation toolkit. You’ll be introduced to the developer-friendly—and free!—community resources available for building games for the PC, Xbox, and Windows Phone and learn more about this industry-changing game development technology.</p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Ryan Vice:  </strong><em>State Management in Windows 8 Metro Applications</em></p>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Metro introduces a new application lifecyle in which your application could be terminated at anytime. This example driven session will explore how to write applications that sucessfully manage persisted, session and view state in the Metro environment allowing you to provide a good user experience for your end users. The concepts apply to all Metro development but will be demonstrated using C# and XAML.</p>


<p>After that, Headspringers disperse to “get nerdy with it.”  If you’re in town, plan on stopping by to visit Katie in the sponsor area.  She’ll have swag, stickers, and as always, good conversation.  Pick up one of these beauties for your car bumper, and share the photo on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Headspring/280556282000204">Facebook wall</a>!</p>
