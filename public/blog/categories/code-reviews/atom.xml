    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, not YOU, of course. YOUR team's code reviews, I'm sure, are pleasant, productive engagements where everybody leaves feeling good about the results. They happen early and regularly in the development process, the goal of the review is well understood, and you wouldn't dream of shipping a line of code that hadn't been through your review process. Your team loves doing them, and you don't worry about who does the review because you've got a consistent standard that your whole team agrees with. You're just reading this article because there's this <em>other </em>team in the building that you think would benefit from reading it, and you're going to forward it to them when you're done reading.</p>


<p>I'm with you. Personally, I've <em>never</em> sat around a meeting table with 15 other developers, all checking their email, while one poor sacrificial lamb walked us through a line-by-line explanation of code in "Representative changeset XYZ" the day <em>after</em> we put it into production. I've <em>never</em> been told (or said!) "That's good feedback, but we don't have time to re-test those changes before the release date." And I've <em>never, ever</em> had an hours-long debate about where our braces should go.</p>


<p>Really.</p>


<p>But, for the benefit of that <em>other</em> team, I've put together some advice about  <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/resources/whitepapers/" target="_blank">how to conduct effective code reviews</a></span>. Some of the things I cover are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Understanding why we do code reviews in the first place</li>
<li>Using code reviews to drive quality in your products early</li>
<li>Getting a consistent code style across your team so you can focus on higher-level issues</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div>Come take a look at <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://www.headspring.com/resources/whitepapers/" target="_blank">Conducting Effective Code Reviews</a></span></em>, and remember to share it with the guys down the hall who <em>actually</em> need it!</div>
