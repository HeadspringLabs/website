<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">By Eric Sollenberger:</span></span></em></p>
<p>The BCS formula has determined that Auburn and Oregon will square off in the BCS National<br />
Championship Game. What does this have to do with your company&#8217;s legacy system? More<br />
than you might think.</p>
<h2>One: It sounded like a good idea at the time.</h2>
<p>As strange as it may sound, the BCS system was created to solve a problem. The old<br />
way of crowning a national champion failed for the first time in 1992. Mark Brunell&#8217;s<br />
Washington Huskies had won their bowl game and finished the season undefeated. In<br />
most seasons this would have been enough to secure the national championship, but<br />
this year was different. The University of Miami (featuring Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson)<br />
had likewise finished the regular season undefeated and pummeled Nebraska in the Orange<br />
Bowl. Although The Rock would go on to claim to be &#8220;The People&#8217;s Champion,&#8221; the national<br />
title was declared a tie. Everyone threw a big fit because there were two national<br />
champions, and America doesn&#8217;t do ties. Something had to be done—and the solution<br />
was to be the Bowl Championship Series. The BCS ranking formula would include the<br />
opinions of people who talk about sports on TV, coaches who are allowed to vote for<br />
their own teams, and six computers that would calculate secret algorithms. What could<br />
possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>Like college football, businesses grow and change over time. Systems evolve naturally<br />
around activities and tasks that are of higher value to the bottom line. Back in the<br />
day, it was easy to tweak the system. Putting a file in a different inbox, or firing<br />
the guy with messy handwriting was how things got done. Then businesses grew and grew<br />
and grew, until they could produce no more without bringing in an IT expert to automate<br />
everything. To quote the slick talking software-salesman: <em>&#8220;Using this great new<br />
system of expensive software that only a couple of people understand, your business<br />
will be free to expand, and the system probably won&#8217;t have to ever be changed! Even<br />
if some minor adjustments have to be made, I&#8217;m sure it would be no problem to find<br />
someone who can do it right, and every employee will have no problem at all adjusting<br />
to the new features. What could possibly go wrong?&#8221;</em></p>
<h2>Two: It usually works. But even when it does, it freaks you out right up to the<br />
end.</h2>
<p>For the most part, the BCS rankings put together the two best teams in the country.<br />
It provides us with an entertaining game and a great excuse for some New Year&#8217;s Day<br />
laziness. With the exceptions of 2003 (LSU/USC), and 2004 (USC/Auburn) there haven&#8217;t<br />
been co-national champions since the BCS formula was implemented. Surely a system<br />
that works 85% of the time can&#8217;t be bad.</p>
<p>Although it usually works, there&#8217;s the <em>potential</em> for disaster every time.<br />
Every November, there is a possibility that 3, 4, or sometimes 5 teams would have<br />
a legitimate claim to play in the looming national title game. Fan bases get all worked<br />
up, and Lou Holtz gets so flustered he can&#8217;t speak.</p>
<p>Legacy systems are the same way. If you&#8217;ve survived a few screw-ups before, you&#8217;ll<br />
survive them again. As long as the orders go through the same way each time eventually<br />
you&#8217;ll get your funding/paycheck, and there&#8217;s probably not a reason to change anything.<br />
We know a lot of people who&#8217;ve been dealing with the uncertainty of a faulty system<br />
for years. At crunch time, they bite their nails and prepare for the worst. Then at<br />
the last second, everything usually comes together—the system that&#8217;s held up with<br />
duct tape comes through yet again. But hey, they&#8217;re no worse for the wear.</p>
<h2>Three: The guys who designed it spend more time counting their money than fixing<br />
the problems.</h2>
<p><img style="float: left; padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" title="traditional software vendors" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/traditional-software-vendors.gif" alt="traditional software vendors" />It&#8217;s<br />
almost cliché to skewer the NCAA and money-hungry college Presidents. Yes, they make<br />
loot hand-over-foot while the masses demand a playoff. But give them credit—they designed<br />
a system that usually delivers what consumers want and supplies enormous profits for<br />
their schools. After all, boosting revenue for the universities and conferences is<br />
one of the most important parts of their jobs. Without this revenue, schools would<br />
be forced to slash research budgets, cut programs, and generally lose their ability<br />
to equip young men and women with the tools needed to succeed in the world. Sure,<br />
they&#8217;ll listen to important boosters and the bully pulpit that is the NCAA, but they&#8217;re<br />
not going to rush to change anything unless it&#8217;s worth their while.</p>
<p>As opposed to the NCAA, the software team you selected usually builds exactly what<br />
you tell them to. That might be the problem. Chances are your vendor is not going<br />
to know your business as well as you do. The development team should understand the<br />
&#8220;who, what, when, and where,&#8221; and most importantly the &#8220;why.&#8221; This involves some up-front<br />
commitment in time, and a little bit of back and forth between the two of you to ensure<br />
that they get it. Ideally, the vendor that you choose should be able to listen to<br />
your requirements, but also be able to make suggestions about something that might<br />
work better in the long run.</p>
<h2>Four: It&#8217;s the only game in town.</h2>
<p>Every year people discuss boycotting the national championship game. There&#8217;s always<br />
the guy at the bar who says, &#8220;I love college football, but I&#8217;m not going to watch<br />
the BCS games until they put in a playoff.&#8221;</p>
<p>That guy is a liar. He is going to cave in and watch the sport he loves, played at<br />
the highest level for the last time until September. People have the option to watch<br />
the FCS Playoffs, but I doubt 50 million TVs will tune in to watch football games<br />
that are apparently being played at Roland Garros.</p>
<p>The flaws in a legacy system are similarly well known. There&#8217;s generally a sense of<br />
resignation that you have to make due with what you have. You can&#8217;t just stop using<br />
it; after all, business would grind to a halt. Your other option would be to update<br />
it, and most people don&#8217;t even know where to begin with a project like that. You use<br />
it and learn to tolerate it, because you don&#8217;t have any other recourse. Sometimes<br />
the devil you know is preferable to watching Eastern Washington vs. Delaware.</p>
<h2>Five: It&#8217;s only going to be fixed when the problem becomes more costly than the<br />
solution.</h2>
<p><img style="float: left; padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" title="solution" src="http://blogs.headspring.com/content/binary/solution.jpg" alt="solution" />Great<br />
news NCAA football fans! ESPN has a deal with the BCS that will guarantee the rights<br />
to air all of the BCS games through 2014. For all that&#8217;s broken with the BCS, they&#8217;re<br />
still being paid $125 million per year just for the rights to broadcast the games.<br />
Like it or not, the BCS is nothing if not profitable. That&#8217;s not going to change until<br />
there&#8217;s a run of consecutive co-champions, or a viable alternative with a smooth transition<br />
is offered. Mark Cuban, the ball is in your court.</p>
<p>People ask, &#8220;When should I do something about our legacy system?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple math really.</p>
<p>How many orders/grants/contracts has the system cost you? How much time do you spend<br />
worrying about, fixing, or paying others to handle issues with the current system?<br />
What is your hourly rate? Add those numbers together and you get an idea of how much<br />
the legacy system is costing you. From there it&#8217;s pretty simple to figure out what<br />
your budget should be and when you will recognize a return on that investment. Maybe<br />
it makes sense to keep using the current one in spite of all its flaws. Maybe there&#8217;s<br />
a place in this world for somewhat serviceable broken-down systems that used to be<br />
fast. After all, Mark Brunell still has a job.</p>
<p>If you have run the numbers and realize it is time to invest in a way out of your<br />
legacy system, <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/" target="_blank">Headspring</a> would<br />
like to speak with you and we hope you will <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com/contact/" target="_blank">contact<br />
us</a>. Helping enterprises out of legacy systems is what we do best. If you select<br />
another vendor, please do due diligence and choose well. You will be frustrated if<br />
the &#8220;solution&#8221; is a brand new legacy system. Example: BCS</p>
