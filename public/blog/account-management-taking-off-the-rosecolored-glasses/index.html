<div class="entry-content"><p>You have probably, at least once, ended an email with this statement:</p>
<p>“If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.”</p>
<p>How effective has this attempt at quarrying feedback ever been for you? My guess is that this sentiment probably does not move far pass pleasantries. It’s nice. It’s open. But is it really welcoming?</p>
<p>In account management, honest and timely feedback is of utmost importance. This is the case not only to achieve project goals but also to secure long-lasting relationships. Selling to existing accounts is often characterized as “low–hanging fruit,” but reality speaks much differently. Twenty-four percent of custom software projects are cancelled before completion or never used. I can only imagine how a healthy dose of careful account management in these cases could have changed the failed outcome. Client retention is actually very hard work and depends on the careful attention paid to feedback given to a trustworthy account manager.<!--more--></p>
<p>Some clients are powerfully communicative, allowing account managers and consultants to focus on satisfying the scope of the project objectives. With these people, you don’t have to worry about whether you’ll get useful responses to your request for comments. You also don’t have to worry about if you are welcoming enough because you know it’s coming anyway.</p>
<p>One thing that keeps us from pressing for feedback is what I call “happy ears.” These conversations tend to be brief and end on a good note:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image15.png"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image: initial; border-width: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" width="518" height="266" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Two factors play into this scenario: The psychology of the person asking questions and the psychology of the person answering questions. The person answering seeks approval by giving praise and the person asking stops once they receive praise for a job well done. The person asking the questions has his/her happy ears on, and they don’t press for more feedback because that would be more work. The person answering the question then assumes that their feedback would be disregarded or would disrupt a good working relationship with a reliable vendor. This need for approval creates communication walls on both sides.</p>
<p>So how is it possible to garner feedback from a client that is not an effective communicator? In other words, how do I get constructive feedback from a <em>seemingly</em> <em>satisfied</em> client?</p>
<p>Some like to start with the Rule of Three: ask the same question three times, in three different ways, and get to the truth. Here’s an example of the supposed conversation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image16.png"><img style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" width="515" height="480" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We had to ask three times, but eventually we get to the reality of our situation. Had we not pressed the issue, would we have known about these issues? The results shouldn’t be surprising to the consulting team. Account managers should be able to bring this feedback to the consulting team, and the team should have an action plan already in place to acknowledge these shortcomings. However, having an account manager available to ask the right questions and empathize with the client&#8217;s perception of the project ensures a new level of trust and respect between the client and the organization. This can turn a satisfied client into a return customer.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to place account managers on every project and stress the importance of their role. Have them hold proactive meetings, even when things are going well. Meet in person, often. Shake hands. Share a meal together. Uncover all assumptions, and get to know your client’s wants and desires on a personal level.</p>
<p>Some companies have separate departments for account management, but we utilize our sales team because they are the original point of contact.</p>
<p>Who fills the client satisfaction role in your organization? What can they do to better uncover the hidden opportunities and areas for improvement?</p>
