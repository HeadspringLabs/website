<p>Who didn’t want to do any planning.</p>
<p>She wrote teh codes,</p>
<p>And even this ode,</p>
<p>But found that her rhymes were uncanny.”</p>
<p>Officially, she is the NHibernate master of Headspring.  However, Anne Epstein has been in web development since 1998.  She has followed its many changes with a close eye ever since. She has achieved what now can be labeled as “adaptive expertise” in understanding how technology changes - and how to change with it.</p>
<p>For all this and more, Anne has proven herself as an indispensable team member at Headspring through careful risk mitigation, attention to detail, and valuable communication skills.</p>
<p>“She is great at looking around dark corners and cracks for danger; we are able to better anticipate what our clients need because of her,” says Glenn Burnside, Director of Software Development.  For example, with a recent client, she was noted for being proactive about finding a solution which allowed constant monitoring of a software system we were hosting.  This proactive system prevented server errors, even outside of business hours.  Anne will tell you that this ability to calculate risk stems from her childhood fear of… everything.  “I couldn’t even fantasize about what I wanted to be as a kid! I was constantly worried about the dangers of the various professions I was drawn to, like firefighting, or teaching, or whatever.”</p>
<p>As young Anne matured through her fears and experiences, she developed an incredible skill for microscopic attention to detail.  This skill is what her teammates enjoy most about working alongside her.  They enjoy not having to explain every premise in order to discuss a project.  “She just gets it! I know that if I hand something over, she’ll figure it out,” says Principal Consultant Mahendra Mavini.  This fascination with detail is evident in her personal life, as well.  She is drawn to deeply technical challenges and hobbies, such as learning new programming languages (she is currently learning Python), competitive ballroom dancing, and anything involving the use of power tools.  She is even experimenting with a personal project that involves building her own web browser. This is quite the transition from her indecisive childhood!</p>
<p>Although what Anne values most is being truly helpful to those around her.  “I really enjoy helping people accomplish things at Headspring.  It’s not just about money here.  There is integrity in what we do.” Particularly, Anne values honest and valuable communication.  “Developers often want to one-up their clients, instead of just helping them.”  Instead, Anne strives to present her thoughts with clarity and honesty.  She credits her early career in the trenches of tech support for the ability to connect problems to a solution that anyone can understand.  Now that she is in consulting, the same genuine desire to communicate effectively allows her to be helpful with her own clients. Once, she suggested an alternate, open-source approach to a project that could be purchased, instead of having to be custom built.  She was later commended for not taking advantage of the client’s limited knowledge on the subject by promoting her own.  They were able to gain a maintainable solution, for less effort and money.</p>
<p>So if you have any questions about NHibernate, power tools, building a web browser, limerick writing, or ballroom dancing, contact Anne Epstein. It will certainly be more enjoyable than searching Google.  Also, check out her <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/anne_epstein/default.aspx">blog</a>, or tweet @ajepst.</p>
