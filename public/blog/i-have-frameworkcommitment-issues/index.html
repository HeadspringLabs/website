	<h2 class="title">I Have Framework Commitment Issues</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time, a problem was identified. Shortly thereafter a solution was found. After all it wasn&#8217;t a tough problem and the solution was simple. A commercial framework was selected and the solution was implemented. Then it was re-implemented with an open source framework and then rolled back to the commercial framework. Both frameworks were evaluated and the findings revealed both frameworks had the features and functionality to solve the problem within the context of the solution. So what was the reason for indecisiveness?</p>
<p>To put it simply, it was a matter of commitment to a license.</p>
<p>Many folks in information technology have to evaluate software because there are typically at least two or more software packages that accomplish similar functions. Think about how many content management systems are available. Or how many virtualization solutions you can pick from. How about web servers? Text editors? Operating systems? The list goes on. In the business of software production we are often faced with similar choices. From selecting the programming languages to build tools, from source control to the integrated development environment (IDE), we are constantly tasked with evaluating things and selecting them. We make choices all the time.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, all the decisions would be as simple as picking the right tool for the job. That&#8217;s where it starts. We start picking the tool for the job. It&#8217;s not a hard thing to do. You eliminate the tools that don&#8217;t work at all. Then you exclude those that only solve part of the problem. You may find yourself with no remaining choices and this complicates things. But generally, you find a few tools that work well. It should be easy to just pick one. Right? A coin toss or a random drawing may seem to be all that is needed. But the fact is - in the real world it&#8217;s not that simple.</p>
<p>Frameworks and software have licenses and the licenses have implications&#8230; and that&#8217;s when you realize, &#8220;I have framework commitment issues&#8221;. How do you overcome these issues when selecting frameworks? It&#8217;s not always easy, but by asking a few questions the selection can become more apparent.</p>
<p><strong>How is the framework supported?</strong></p>
<p>When things go wrong and you need help, who will be there to help fix the problem? Will you have to fix it yourself?</p>
<p>Most open source software support is provided by the community. The community includes you. So aside from yourself, no one is under any obligation to help you. This means you should have the ability and resources to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Commercially licensed frameworks on the other hand usually offer some type of incident support.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it falls on you to make sure your solution works and meets expectations. Neither types of licenses free you from this.</p>
<p><strong>Is the framework proven?</strong></p>
<p>Who is using it and what do they have riding on it? Do some homework and ask around. There are many great commercial and open source frameworks.</p>
<p>If you have a lot riding on the framework you are about to select, you may want to conservatively go with a framework that is tried and true. It&#8217;s a safe bet until you use it in a way that has never been used before, but those situations are rare.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there won&#8217;t be a tried and true framework available. You should still ask around. It is rare to find yourself in a position where you are attempting something completely new that is not even remotely similar to another problem.</p>
<p>While your problem and solution may be unique, it does not imply that there no other problems or solutions that share similar traits.</p>
<p><strong>What resources are available to help you use the framework?</strong></p>
<p>Is there a book? A user group? A conference? Does anyone offer a training course or certification program? How good is the online documentation? Don&#8217;t forget to look for a bundled help file.</p>
<p><strong>What does the framework cost? The total cost?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Commercial software licenses are not free. Some get really expensive. But don&#8217;t let this deter you from purchasing it.</p>
<p>Open source software is free. Sort of. Think about what it may cost to support it in the event you can&#8217;t find any community help.</p>
<p>For either type of license, you are likely to incur cost related to learning the framework. Whether it is a developer&#8217;s time while they research it on the Internet or an intense multi-day certification course, expect to incur some direct and/or indirect cost.</p>
<p>Risk is inevitable. You can minimize this risk by using tried and true frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>Should I build my own?</strong></p>
<p>This is the most expensive and riskiest option. Let me state that one more time for good measure&#8230;</p>
<p>This is the most expensive and riskiest option. Sure you won&#8217;t have to worry about a license fee. You can also be certain you will be the one to support it (even if you open source it). Books, training, events, certifications, and similar resources won&#8217;t exist unless you make them (or you open source it and even then it’s not guaranteed).</p>
<p>Avoid rolling your own.</p>
<p><strong>How do I make the commitment?</strong></p>
<p>Pick a framework. As a rule of thumb pick a framework that meets your needs the best (even if it has a significant commercial license fee). If you have few good ones to choose from, consider the questions discussed. If you still can&#8217;t decide&#8230; flip a coin.</p>
