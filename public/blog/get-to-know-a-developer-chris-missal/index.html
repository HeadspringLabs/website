<p>And his interests don’t stop there.  He’s currently learning Python, and along with coding, he likes disc golf and bowling.  He just moved to Austin from Iowa, and is really looking forward to getting into the social scene.  “The developer community is so lively here that I’ll be looking to get involved with groups that are passionate about making their communities so wonderful,” said Chris.</p>
<p>Here is how the rest of our talk went:</p>
<p><strong>Are you an expert at anything?</strong></p>
<p>I feel like somebody probably won’t write a book about something unless they could be considered an expert on the matter. I’ll answer this question by responding to the things that I think I could write a book about. A few things I could picture myself writing about: Unit testing, object-oriented programming and web page markup. Two things I’d love to add to that list that I’m working on is git and JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on your list of ideal clients to work for or individuals to work with?</strong></p>
<p>I think it would be really to fun to work with the team at GitHub. I think I would have a good time working with people building things like cars that drive themselves, space shuttles, undersea experiments, you know, the usual.</p>
<p><strong>What led you to software development?</strong></p>
<p>I became interested in technology in grade school while playing video games. As internet shifted more mainstream, I learned that I could play games online. This led me to take an interest in computers and the internet. While I’m not as much of a gamer as I used to be, I’m still very interested in building things that require human interaction. My primary focus is web sites and web applications.</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn first?</strong></p>
<p>My first programming language was QBASIC. It started with me tinkering around in the Gorillas game, and not too long later I was writing my own game with sprites and even mouse support! My “gaming career” was short lived and I soon started building simple web pages, learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Do you like teaching?</strong></p>
<p>I really do like teaching and training people on all sorts of topics. While I might feel outside my comfort zone when it comes to topics that are new to me, the things that I’m really experienced in are quite fun to teach to people. My favorite part of teaching is when I’m asked a really good question. Not only does that help me realize that they’re getting it, but it allows me to adjust and make sure I cover it next time.</p>
<p><strong>Where do begin when learning something new?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to libraries and frameworks I usually start with source code, and hopefully on GitHub. Since not everything is open source, I like to use tools like Decompilers to understand what is really going on within the project. Blog posts are also really great to reference. When it comes to methodology and management skills, I prefer hard copy books.</p>
