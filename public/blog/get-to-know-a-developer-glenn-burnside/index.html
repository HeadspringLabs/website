	<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2011/12/get-to-know-a-developer-glenn-burnside/glenn-burnside-small2" rel="attachment wp-att-2620"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2620" title="Glenn-Burnside-Small2" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Glenn-Burnside-Small2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>If Glenn Burnside never wrote a string of code, he would still be a great leader.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we get the best of both worlds from him at Headspring.  He is a really good developer and a really good boss.  In fact, these attributes are symbiotic</p>
<p>Glenn Burnside, Director of Software Development, is an accomplished manager at Headspring because he is supportive, and grants his employees the autonomy to be creative.  He is frequently celebrated for his unwavering support, coaching and guidance.  He has his eye on the prize, and all the confidence needed to motivate our entire development team.  His genuine enthusiasm for the culture of Headspring trickles through the company and everything it touches. The result is happy employees, a happy Headspring, and happy clients.</p>
<p>He will tell you his secret to project management is list making.  He keeps lists for everything he is responsible for at work, for household projects, for his work as a Cub Scout leader, and for personal goals. He refers to his lists constantly during the day, and he is always adding items on and checking items off.  Whatever he is doing, most people would agree that his goal is to finish it.</p>
<p>However, Glenn’s employees really appreciate him as a manager because he is highly qualified in their field.  As a developer, he is able to give credible advice about writing real code.  Specifically, his employees benefit from his knowledge and experience in developing frameworks that are used by other teams.</p>
<p>Glenn has been programming in C# and .NET since 2000, starting with the very first preview release that came out of Microsoft PDC.  This was back before .NET was even called .NET.  Since then, he’s shipped products on every version of the .NET Framework – 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0. These days he’s spending spare time looking at how his team at Headspring can do more as developers with Powershell to boost productivity, and is looking at NuGet as a tool for leveraging deployment and library packaging.</p>
<p>Before joining Headspring, Glenn was the lead architect for globalizing Dell’s shopping cart and profile management applications.  He led a team of only 5 full-time staff members to rebuild both applications so they had a single shopping cart solution worldwide, that could be globally deployed in under 2 hours for all 5 business regions.  Glenn says, “I’m really proud of this effort because we did it without rewriting the whole thing from scratch, which is what was initially proposed.  I found a way to accomplish what the business needed, at a tenth of the original price.”</p>
<p>We rely on Glenn because of his commitment to creating and implementing quality. Because he cares for his team and the client equally, he is able to deliver maintainable solutions with no surprises.</p>
<p>What more can we ask for?</p>
