Jose currently lives in Houston, but he’s originally from the Dominican Republic. I was so excited to speak with him because he told me that participating in <a href="http://www.headspring.com/mary/headspring-hosts-central-texas-givecamp-to-benefit-10-local-non-profits/" target="_blank">CTX GiveCamp</a> (one of my projects last year) convinced him to look into working for us full time. In fact, Jose was on the TX Kidney Foundation team, which won CTX GiveCamp’s highest honor: the “Meg Ryan Facelift Award for Coolest UI”. I knew he was a winner. Here’s the rest of our conversation:</p>
<p>Where did you work, and what did you do before coming to Headspring?</p>
<p>I was a senior developer at Dril-Quip, Inc., a manufacturer of oil and gas drilling equipment in Houston. Prior to that, I worked in various roles in application and database administration at Compaq / HP.</p>
<p>What or who made you want to work here?</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have worked for companies where software was a cost-center. I wanted the opportunity to work for a company where my efforts directly contribute to the bottom-line. I also wanted work along-size like-minded individuals that have a passion for learning and moving their careers forward. I believe Headspring is that company.</p>
<p>What led you to software development?</p>
<p>Computers are better than humans at performing repetitive tasks in a fast and consistent manner. I wanted to automate my day-to-day activities as a database admin. This led me to learn scripting languages, and I enjoyed that so much that moved into full-blown development.</p>
<p>What did you learn first?</p>
<p>I started by learning VBScript to create windows scripts and dynamic web pages back in the day.</p>
<p>Do you like teaching?</p>
<p>I love teaching and learning new things. The best way to truly learn and become an expert at something is to teach it.  I think that in the process of simplifying a topic in order to teach it to others, we gain clarity of mind and reach those “aha” moments in our understanding of the subject.</p>
