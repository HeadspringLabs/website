<div class="entry-content"><p>When I first discovered I would be managing a team, I have to admit it was a bit intimidating. After being led by some mediocre managers and a few really bad managers, I wasn’t sure how I would stack up. Was it even possible to be a good manager? Much less a great manager? It has been a little over a month since starting my team and I wanted to document a few nuggets that were taught to me along the way. In no way is this blog the be-all and end-all of flawless management, but I do think that remembering these few crucial points will keep me from being a bad manager.<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My position’s most important role now is to get my employees promoted.</strong> My job is no longer just executing my daily tasks; my success depends on their success. I believe that mangers often mistakenly believe that the employee is there to help get them promoted. Having a person under you will not automatically give you a better title, double productivity, or be able to pass off all the unwanted tasks you don’t like as to not deal with them anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The sooner you start thinking about your employee’s future the better.</strong> Since it is now clear that my job as a manager is to get employees promoted, I need to be sure to send them down a path that they will be successful at and want. Talking with employees about where they see themselves going and being honest about what will be needed from them in the future is extremely important. This is the best way to be sure that both parties’ expectations are aligned.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create black and white criteria with your employee for reaching that promotion.</strong> If you talk a lot about wanting to get them to the next level but never let them know how to reach it, that can foster bitterness. Make the metrics measurable, reasonable, and obtainable. It is important to make the metrics about behaviors and not results. This will help keep employee from feeling the metrics are out of their control and the promotion is just a carrot at the end of a stick.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provide the tools and remove road blocks for your employee to complete the defined criteria.</strong> When an employee comes to me asking for help and I am in the middle of doing something, sometimes I have to remind myself of this. This is not a coming of age test where you send them out into the desert with a switch blade and a cantina of water. It should be more like backpacking with someone that has done it before. You are still going to have to walk yourself and carry your stuff, but I am there to tell you not to wear deodorant because it attracts bears.</li>
</ul>
<p></br><br />
This is where I am so far.  I have got a lot to learn and lots of mistakes to make, but if you have any words of advice I would greatly appreciate them. Just leave me a comment below.</p>
