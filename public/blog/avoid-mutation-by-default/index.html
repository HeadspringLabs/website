	<h2 class="title">Avoid Mutation by Default</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Several weeks back, I was <a href="http://www.headspring.com/patrick/low-ceremony-xunit/">customizing xUnit</a> to cut down on ceremony in my tests.  When I ran into some trouble, I started looking through the source code for xUnit, and saw something a little surprising: tests within a test class are executed in a random order.  Sure, tests need to be isolated so that test execution order doesn&#8217;t affect their success or failure, but randomizing within the test runner seemed like overkill.</p>
<p>If it ever caught an issue, it still wouldn&#8217;t tell me where the problem was, right?  It seemed like it would be better to execute in a deterministic order so that when I <em>do</em> get myself into trouble, it will be reproducible trouble.  Today, though, I was grateful for this behavior.  If you&#8217;re running tests frequently during development, the very fact that your newly-coded tests start failing at random <strong>is</strong> informative: <em>&#8220;What test is wrong?  The one that I just wrote.&#8221;</em></p>
<h2>A Trivial Yet Broken Class</h2>
<p>I was working on a routine whose job was to produce a date range after taking into account several business rules.  If none of the rules applied, we wanted to return the range [DateTime.MinValue, DateTime.MaxValue] to indicate &#8220;all the dates we could ever possibly care about&#8221;.  Each business rule could possibly shorten this range, affecting the start, the end, or both.  The overall result was, basically, the range where several other ranges overlapped.  I started by creating a helper class, DateRange, as a glorified pair of DateTimes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3949963.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>To make it clear to the reader that we were starting with &#8220;all the dates we could ever possibly care about&#8221; and subsequently narrowing that down to the overlapping range, I added a static field:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3949966.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>This field allowed the main algorithm to look something like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3950102.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Do you see the bug?  <strong>The terrible, horrible, no good, very bad bug?</strong>  xUnit did.</p>
<p>The 3 rules I was applying were involved yet test-friendly, so it was easy to implement several tests to make sure my bases were covered.  All was well, until I got to the seventh test.  It failed with an impossible result.  The dates in the resulting range didn&#8217;t even show up anywhere in my test setup.  Mystified, I ran that test in the debugger.  It passed!  I ran the whole test class a few times, and this one test would pass or fail at random.  This was extremely odd, as the code under test seemed to be clearly deterministic.</p>
<h2>Excessive Mutation</h2>
<p>Realizing that xUnit was running my tests in a different order each time helped me to see my mistake.  This implementation of DateRange is mutable, and AllOfTime is static and therefore shared.  AllOfTime is a shared mutable thing whose name suggests an immutable thing.  AllOfTime is lying.</p>
<p>I had broken my own rule: I make classes immutable by default, making them mutable as soon as being dogmatic starts to hurt.  Instead, I had made this mutable from the start and immediately tripped on my own intellectual shoelaces.  Marking the properties as read-only forced me to rephrase the main logic, but that actually resulted in simplifying everything and ensured that AllOfTime is in fact <em>all</em> of it:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3949968.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>DateRange deserves to be a value just like DateTimes deserve to be values.  You can&#8217;t <em>change</em> 10/24/2012 any more than you can change the number 5. 5 will always be 5, 10/24/2012 will always be 10/24/2012, and the range [10/24/2012, 10/31/2012] will always be the range [10/24/2012, 10/31/2012].</p>
<p>As a general rule, I avoid mutation.  If I did that everywhere, though, my code would likely become too hard to follow.  As soon as keeping things immutable becomes a larger pain than the pain it solves, I back off and allow mutable state to come into the picture.  Even then, I try to limit the &#8220;footprint&#8221; of that state change.</p>
<p>Unnecessary mutation makes it too easy to make trivial mistakes.</p>
