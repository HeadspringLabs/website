	<div class="entry-content"><p>I guess I would consider myself an events butterfly. There is not a week that goes by that I do not attend a user group, special interest group, conference or unconference, networking event or some other form of peer to peer learning and networking.</p>
<p>I was recently asked if going to all of these events was really worth the time. My answer to them is the answer I give to everyone. There is always one person you will have a conversation with, one speaker giving a presentation, or one bit of information that makes the time completely worth it. If nothing else, you usually get a free drink or some food out of it. But in all seriousness, I cannot express enough the importance of attending these events.</p>
<p>I am not saying that it is valuable for an individual to attend every event that is going on within a 20 mile radius. I do think it is key to pick groups and events that are not only crucial for the industry your company represents, but also the groups that will help you with your career.</p>
<p>This past weekend I attended Austin ProductCamp, a semiannual event for product managers and product marketers. A message they have consistently reminded all attendees of is “a meeting is only what you make of it”. They suggest instead of messing around with your phone during session breaks, take advantage of your peers that are there to learn more too. Instead of only exchanging business cards be sure to follow up with people. It doesn’t count to just go home and connect with them on LinkedIn. Instead of staying in a session that isn&#8217;t giving you what you need, use your two feet (the two foot rule at ProductCamp) and go to a different session.</p>
<p>Even though ProductCamp is making these recommendations, their lessons and practices can be used to make all events you attend worth your time. What are you looking to get out of the events you attend?</p>
