	<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.headspring.com/2012/01/get-to-know-a-developer-pedro-reys/pedro" rel="attachment wp-att-3276"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3276" title="pedro" src="http://www.headspring.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pedro-291x300.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="240" /></a>This week I spent some time getting to know Pedro Reys, one of our Senior Consultants at Headspring.  We had a great time talking about <em>consuming</em> technology, and what that means in the past, present and the future.  While we both agreed that invention of indoor plumbing (originally my suggestion) was an important milestone in technology, the internet has ultimately surpassed any and all twenty-first century technical advancements.  Here’s how the rest of our conversation went:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Tell me about how you progressed from a good developer to a great developer.</strong></p>
<p>Since joining Headspring, I do more back-end work than front-end work, but that wasn’t on purpose.  I did a lot of web development before coming here, and I still enjoy reading up on what’s new in web development.  Part of being a consultant is being exposed to everything, so I have gone from good to great by broadening my skill set.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like most about being a consultant?</strong></p>
<p>I like the exposure and the challenges.  I would get really bored if I was just doing one more of the same thing all the time.  Consulting work is never monotonous because I get to work with all sorts of different companies, teams, and products.  I find that to be a really rewarding process.</p>
<p><strong>What do you wish more people in the tech industry cared about?</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to find developers that 1) know their craft well 2) do their part in the community and 3) have people skills.  Many of our clients come to us with bad experiences from great consultancies that have great developers, but fail in the people department.   Being a consultant has taught me to really listen to the client, focus on a smart solution, and choose my battles wisely.  I wish more developers spent time learning how to communicate with people as well as they do with machines.</p>
<p><strong>What companies do you admire?</strong></p>
<p>Zappos has really great customer service.  I bought a pair of shoes as a gift for someone recently, but they ended up being the wrong size.  I contacted a rep, and he was very understanding.  I did not feel like he was just trying to get rid of me.  He expedited shipping on a new pair, free of charge, no questions asked.  This week, they were hacked, and I got an upfront email explaining what happened and what they were planning to do about it.  I liked the transparency of their email, and how they handled it says a lot about their brand’s values.</p>
<p><strong>What technology do you wish you had sooner?</strong></p>
<p>The Wikipedia blackout really affected me.  I don’t know how I managed to get through college without it.  It would have been awesome to have Wikipedia when I was in school.  Also, I wish I had an iPhone sooner.  How did I get around before?  I know life existed before the internet, but it’s a lot better now that we have it.  It’s much more important to be able to know how to get the information you need faster than just having it memorized.</p>
