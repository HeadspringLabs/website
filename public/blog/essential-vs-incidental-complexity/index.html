<div class="entry-content"><p>Confession time: I might not be perfect.  Thankfully, though, that&#8217;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve coded myself into a bit of a corner, and it&#8217;s all my fault, but as I said above my imperfection is irrelevant.  What&#8217;s relevant is that when one is faced with a software project that&#8217;s heading in the wrong direction, the problems can always be identified and addressed.  <strong>Code is just too malleable to be intractable.</strong>  Realizing you have a coding problem is the first step to recovery.<!--more--></p>
<h2>What Success Feels Like</h2>
<p>Last week, I wrote about some lessons learned from a <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/meta-yak-shaving/">yak shaving</a> project that I&#8217;ve been working on for the last year.  As that yak is now sufficiently sheared, I&#8217;ve shifted gears back to my <em>real</em> pet project, a compiler for the language summarized <a href="http://www.headspring.com/blog/developer-deep-dive/building-a-language/">here</a>.</p>
<p>While working on Parsley, adding each new feature actually became <em>easier</em> over time.  I had <del>found</del> <del>planned</del> <em>stumbled into</em> the proper abstractions for the task at hand, and it was always clear what I should do next in order to move the project forward while leaving the campground cleaner than I found it.  </p>
<h2>Suspicious Difficulties</h2>
<p>With Rook, I&#8217;m finding lately that adding each new feature is getting <em>harder</em>.  Quite so, actually.  Each new feature is interacting very tightly with those already implemented, and they&#8217;re starting to interfere with forward progress.  I may be an hour into implementing a feature, even a simple one like adding support for comment syntax, before realizing that my attempt needs to be reverted.  Adding <a href="https://github.com/plioi/rook/commit/3a5ff34c9a8423c21608f3c876d4212eb0f9cddf">basic support for type checking of method calls</a> was the product of about 1 month and N+1 false starts, and includes more unfortunate compromises than I would usually allow myself.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty in adding new features is a tell-tale sign that I&#8217;ve got the wrong abstractions in place.</strong>  Odd, though, since the problem I&#8217;m working on is the poster child for Solved Problems.  There&#8217;s a great deal of prior art I&#8217;m building on, here, so I&#8217;m confident that the overall design is actually still right.  The abstractions that I would fit into an elevator pitch are not the problem.  Probably.</p>
<h2>Is There Hope? (Spoiler Alert: Yes)</h2>
<p>The question is, am I having difficulty due to <strong>essential complexity</strong> or <strong>incidental complexity</strong>?  Is the complexity inherent in the problem being solved (essential) or is it a byproduct of poor implementation details (incidental)?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m leaning towards incidental.  I&#8217;m not exactly breaking RSA encryption here; that&#8217;s a job for quirky characters on procedural crime shows.  Since my difficulties are likely not just a matter of the problem being tough, it&#8217;s a sign that these recent hurdles are really telling me something.</p>
<p>To sum up the situtation,<br />
1. I have reason to believe the complexity I&#8217;m experiencing is not essential to the problem.  Rather, it&#8217;s in my control.<br />
2. My <em>key</em> abstractions are probably right, as they&#8217;re the same used by Every Single Compiler Ever Made.<br />
3. The increasing difficulty to add new features suggests that I <em>do</em> have poor abstractions somewhere.</p>
<p>This train of thought leads me to suspect the <em>other</em> abstractions, the ones I&#8217;ve been inventing myself along the way as I try to fill in the gaps of my own understanding of all that prior art.  This hunch is consistent with the last few hurdles I&#8217;ve run into.</p>
<p>This is great news!  Rather than dispair (&#8220;Oh woe is me, I done goofed!&#8221;), I have every reason to believe that the answers are now reachable.  I need to take a closer look at the abstractions I&#8217;ve invented along the way, the ones I&#8217;ve made with insufficient forethought regarding future prioritized features.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve focused too much time on sharpening my jigsaw&#8217;s blades, and not enough time on what the puzzle is actually supposed to look like when it&#8217;s done.  Lo and behond, I&#8217;ve forgotten to cut out the edge pieces.</p>
<p>Now that I know the difficulties are due to incidental complexity rather than essential complexity, I know I should slow down on adding new features while I address the problem abstractions.  Overall, my throughput will probably speed up.  I can start to work in earnest on phasing out this incidental complexity.  No &#8220;Grand Rewrite&#8221; for me!</p>
