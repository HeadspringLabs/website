<div class="entry-content"><p>Most of my first job out of college was spent doing desktop development, some of which was in VB6.  I didn&#8217;t love it, but it was easy to learn.  When <em>this</em> button is clicked, <em>that</em> function runs in response to it.  Easy.</p>
<p>The controls-and-event-handlers model combined with the language also made it exceptionally easy to create a tangled pile of misplaced responsibilities, but I think you&#8217;ve got to experience that kind of pain before you can see that alternatives even <em>exist</em>.  Once you&#8217;ve felt the pain, you can better-evaluate which guidance is actually going to be helpful.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>WebForms Was Designed for Desktop Developers</h2>
<p>Right around that time, .NET was released.  ASP.NET WebForms shared little with classic ASP.  The primary goal was to let desktop VB developers make a smooth transition to both .NET and web development at the same time.  With that goal in mind, WebForms provided a similar controls-and-event-handlers model.  Making a web app felt like making a desktop app.</p>
<p>In order to support that approach, WebForms had to make the stateless world of HTTP <em>feel</em> stateful.  View State, the Page Life Cycle, and event handlers allowed the developer to go through the familiar motions of dropping controls onto a designer and wiring up methods to control events, <em>all while ignoring everything that was actually happening</em>.</p>
<p>Abstractions leak, though, and this was a <em>huge</em> abstraction.  It helped me get over the initial hurdle to get a web app up and running, but I found the code I wrote was suspiciously like the desktop VB6 mess I&#8217;d wanted to grow beyond.  I was frequently surprised by the effects of the Page Life Cycle, and every time that happened I had to learn a little bit more about how the abstraction worked under the hood:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Oh! There&#8217;s a Big Honking &lt;form&gt; Tag for the whole page, and it contains an Enormous Encoded &lt;input&gt; Tag containing the current state of all the controls, so whenever I need to hit a button click handler I&#8217;m really submitting a normal HTML form and thenâ€¦&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ugh. Eventually, you just have to know what HTML and HTTP are, even when using WebForms, so the abstraction was no longer helping.</p>
<h2>Many Page Life Cycles Later&#8230;</h2>
<p>While working for a previous employer, ASP.NET MVC came out.  We wanted to try out the new approach, and the timing coincided with a new project that was starting up.  However, there wasn&#8217;t much guidance available yet on how to do it <em>well</em>.  We were challenged at first by the lack of View State, and in order to keep our old &#8220;stateful stateless web&#8221; habit going we ended up storing a <em>lot</em> of things into the user&#8217;s session object.  We also kept treating controller actions like they were event handlers, leading to some awkward-looking URLs.  Distracted by these initial pains, our controllers started absorbing responsibilities like a sponge.  Actually, our <em>controller</em> started absorbing responsibilities - there was only controller in the whole app!</p>
<p>I was writing a lot of controller actions like this:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2410072.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>What I saw was the same thing I saw in WebForms development.  The Controller was the new Code Behind, and I was underwhelmed.  WebForms&#8217;s Page Life Cycle and View State hurt, but the real daily pains came from working with classes that were growing out of control, and I was seeing the same thing with my MVC code.  It seemed like the abstractions were lighter-weight, and it felt right to work with HTML more directly, but I was definitely missing some guidance.</p>
<h2>Turning the Corner</h2>
<p>Several coworkers got to take an <a href="http://www.headspring.com/services/developer-training/mvc-bootcamp">MVC Boot Camp</a> course here at Headspring, and I got to learn by osmosis from them upon their return.  At last, I had a good picture in my head of what it looks like when you&#8217;ve succeeded with these tools.  Our controllers started to get much more lean:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2416902.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>I started to see how the <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/">Onion Architecture</a>, dependency injection, model binders, AutoMapper, and the like help you to keep your controllers small.  MVC wasn&#8217;t a silver bullet; its primary benefit compared to WebForms was that you could make it <em>get out of the way</em> so you could actually start laying down a solid architecture.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC has been around for a few years now.  Community contributions like <a href="http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/">MvcContrib</a> helped to motivate change in subsequent releases, and now ASP.NET MVC is legitimately open-sourced.  Better-yet, guidance on how to do this well has had years to mature.</p>
<p>MVC is a sharper tool than WebForms.  It acknowledges the reality of web technologies like HTML and HTTP, while providing some reasonably-sized abstractions on top of that, such as routing and model binding.  Having a better tool in your toolbelt isn&#8217;t enough, though.  You have to see what it looks like when used correctly.</p>
