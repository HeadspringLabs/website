	<h2 class="title">Anonymous Function Arguments</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>A lambda expression is also called an &#8220;anonymous function&#8221; as it has no official name of its own: <code>x => x + 1</code> does some work, but there&#8217;s no declared name for that function.  Anonymous functions are powerful and expressive, and are now common in .NET projects.</p>
<p>Anonymous function <em>arguments</em>, on the other hand, are weak and inexpressive.  Since the advent of the <code>Func</code> and <code>Action</code> delegate types, anonymous arguments have unfortuanately become as common as anonymous functions.  That is a trend I&#8217;d like to quash ASAP.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Sneaky Ambiguity</h2>
<p>What do I mean by &#8220;anonymous function arguments&#8221;?  Let&#8217;s say someone else has written a method that takes in a <code>Func</code> and then invokes it as part of its own work:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2992221.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you really need to reticulate some splines, and you have a general idea of what function you should be passing into the <code>ReticulateSplines</code> method, but you don&#8217;t happen to really know what the int and bool arguments are supposed to signify.  You confidently put your keyboard to work and get as far as the open-parenthesis in but a few keystrokes:</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2992224.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Alas, your stalled and blinking cursor finds your youthful confidence quaint but ultimately futile.  Visual Studio isn&#8217;t going to be of any use here.  The most you&#8217;ll find out from Intellisense is that you need to supply some function that takes in an int and a bool.  <code>Func</code>&#8217;s declared argument names are <em>arg1</em> and <em>arg2</em>.  These names are so useless that they might as well not exist.  Hence, &#8220;anonymous&#8221; function arguments.</p>
<p><code>ReticulateSplines</code> has a descriptive name for its <em>own</em> argument (<code>generateSplines</code>), but has provided no clue as to what the arguments to this <code>Func</code> are.  If I started writing methods with parameters named <em>arg1</em>, <em>arg2</em>, <em>arg3</em>â€¦ I&#8217;d be immediately despised by every other developer who had to use my code.  Why, then, should I be able to get away with expecting those same developers to make sense of delegate arguments that have equally-ambiguous names?</p>
<h2>Getting Specific</h2>
<p>The <code>delegate</code> keyword gets used less and less now that <code>Func</code> and <code>Action</code> are used for everything.  It&#8217;s time to dust it off and put it to work again.  When faced with the problem of anonymous function arguments, and you can resolve the problem with a simple delegate declaration.</p>
<p>I recently needed to call a method that accepted an <code>Action&lt;Action, Action&gt;</code>.  I had a rough idea of what such an action needed to accomplish, but even after reading the body of the method in question I was unsure of the details.  The two anonymous arguments (the two inner actions) were passed around a bit before they were actually used.  Thankfully, someone had successfully called this method before, and after looking at the concrete method declaration that was being used in that case, I had a real clue what <em>arg1</em> and <em>arg2</em> were supposed to be called.</p>
<p>The fix was to introduce a more useful yet equivalent delegate type.</p>
<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2995736.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code></code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>
<p>Now, I could replace all usages of <code>Action&lt;Action, Action&gt;</code> with <code>SavePromptContinuation</code>.  Back in my own code, Intellisense started offering the help I needed, and more importantly started offering the help that the next developer would inevitably need.  When trying to call a method that accepts one of these, ReSharper even offers to write the method stub for the specific delegate expected, complete with well-named parameters!</p>
<p><code>Func</code> and <code>Action</code> are useful because they are <em>at hand</em>, but the other edge of that sword may just cut your fellow developers.  Here&#8217;s some advice for their use:</p>
<p>1. Use <code>Func</code> and <code>Action</code> when writing something that is inherently so abstract that you can&#8217;t be more specific.<br />
2. You are not writing something that abstract.</p>
